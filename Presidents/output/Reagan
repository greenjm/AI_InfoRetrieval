Prior to his presidency, he served as the33rdGovernor of Californiafrom 1967 to 1975, following a career as an actor and union leader in Hollywood.Raised in a poor family in small towns of Northern Illinois, Ronald Reagan graduated fromEureka Collegein 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations. Moving to Hollywood in 1937, he became an actor, starring in a few major productions. Reagan was twice elected as President of theScreen Actors Guild, the labor union for actors, where he worked to root outCommunist influence. In the 1950s he moved into television and was a motivational speaker atGeneral Electricfactories. Having been a lifelongliberal Democrat, his views changed. He became a conservative and in 1962 switchedto the Republican Party. In1964, Reagan's speech, "A Time for Choosing", in support ofBarry Goldwater's floundering presidential campaign, earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, hewas elected Governor of California in 1966. As governor, Reagan raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at the University of California, ordered National Guard troops in during a period ofprotest movementsin 1969, and wasre-elected in 1970. He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nominations in1968and1976; four years later, he easily won the nomination outright, going on to be elected the oldest President, defeating incumbentJimmy Carterin1980.Entering the presidency in1981, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. Hissupply-side economicpolicies, dubbed "Reaganomics", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survivedan assassination attempt, escalated theWar on Drugs, and foughtpublic-sector labor. Over his two terms, his economic policies saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth ofreal GDPof 3.44%; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his reelection bid, Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was "Morning in America", winning alandslide in 1984with the largest electoral college victory in history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of theCold War, thebombing of Libya, and theIran&ndash;Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an "evil empire", he transitioned Cold War policy fromdétentetorollback, by escalating anarms racewith the USSR while engaging in talks with SovietGeneral SecretaryMikhail Gorbachev, which culminated in theINF Treaty, shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals.[1]During his famous speech at theBrandenburg Gate, President Reagan challenged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to "tear down this wall!" Months after the end of his term, theBerlin Wallfell and theSoviet Union collapsedsoon thereafter.Leaving office in 1989, Reagan held an approval rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those ofFranklin D. Roosevelt, and laterBill Clinton, as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[2]While having planned an active post-presidency, in 1994 Reagan disclosed his diagnosis withAlzheimer's diseaseearlier that year, appearing publicly for the last time at thefuneral of Richard Nixon; hedied ten years laterat the age of 93. An icon among Republicans, he ranks favorably inpublic and critical opinion of U.S. Presidents, and his tenure constituted arealignmenttowardconservativepolicies in the United States.Contents1Early life2Entertainment career2.1Radio and film2.2Military service2.3SAG president2.3.1Secret FBI informant in Hollywood2.4Television3Marriages and children4Early political career, 1948&ndash;675Governor of California (1967&ndash;75)61976 presidential campaign71980 presidential campaign8Presidency (1981&ndash;89)8.1First term, 1981&ndash;858.1.1Prayer in schools and a moment of silence8.1.2Assassination attempt8.1.3Assistant Secretary of State nomination8.1.4Air traffic controllers' strike8.1.5"Reaganomics" and the economy8.1.6Escalation of the Cold War8.1.7Lebanese Civil War (1983)8.1.8Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada, 1983)8.1.91984 presidential campaign8.2Second term, 1985&ndash;898.2.1War on Drugs8.2.2Libya bombing8.2.3Immigration8.2.4Iran&ndash;Contra affair8.2.5End of the Cold War8.3Health8.4Judiciary9Post-presidency (1989&ndash;2004)9.1Alzheimer's disease9.1.1Announcement and reaction9.1.2Progression10Death11Legacy11.1Cold War11.2Domestic and political legacy11.3Cultural and political image11.4Honors12See also13Citations14References14.1Primary sources14.2Historiography15External linksEarly lifeRonald Reagan (with "Dutch" haircut), his elder brother Neil, and their parents Jack and Nelle Reagan. Photograph circa 1916&ndash;17.Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in an apartment on the second floor of acommercial buildinginTampico, Illinoison February 6, 1911, the son ofNelle Clyde (Wilson)andJohn Edward "Jack" Reagan.[3]Reagan's father was a salesman and a storyteller, the grandson ofIrish Catholicimmigrants fromCounty Tipperary,[4]while his mother was of halfScotsand half English descent (Reagan's maternal grandmother was born inSurrey, England).[5]Reagan had one older brother,Neil(1908&ndash;96), who became an advertising executive.[6]As a boy, Reagan's father nicknamed his son "Dutch", due to his "fat little Dutchman"-like appearance, and his "Dutchboy" haircut;[7]the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth.[7]Reagan's family briefly lived in several towns and cities in Illinois, includingMonmouth,Galesburg, and Chicago,[8]in 1919, they returned to Tampico and lived above theH.C. Pitney Variety Storeuntil finally settling inDixon.[3]After his election as president, residing in the upstairs White House private quarters, Reagan would quip that he was "living above the store again".[9]According toPaul Kengor, author ofGod and Ronald Reagan, Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people, which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother, Nelle,[10]and theDisciples of Christfaith,[10]which he was baptized into in 1922.[11]For the time, Reagan was unusual in his opposition to racial discrimination, and recalled a time inDixonwhen the local inn would not allowblack peopleto stay there. Reagan brought them back to his house, where his mother invited them to stay the night and have breakfast the next morning.[12]Ronald Reagan as a teenager inDixon, Illinois.After the closure of the Pitney Store in late 1920, the Reagans moved to Dixon;[13]the midwestern "small universe" had a lasting impression on Reagan.[14]He attendedDixon High School, where he developed interests in acting, sports, and storytelling.[15]His first job was as a lifeguard at theRock Riverin Lowell Park, near Dixon, in 1927. Over a six-year period, Reagan reportedly performed 77 rescues as a lifeguard.[16]Reagan attendedEureka College, a Disciples-oriented liberal arts school, where he became a member of theTau Kappa Epsilonfraternity, a cheerleader, and studied economics and sociology. While involved, theMiller Center of Public Affairsdescribed him as an "indifferent student." He majored in Economics and graduated with a C average.[17]He developed a reputation as a jack of all trades, excelling in campus politics, sports and theater. He was a member of the football team and captain of the swim team. He was elected student body president and led a student revolt against the college president after he tried to cut back the faculty.[18]Entertainment careerFurther information:Ronald Reagan filmographyRadio and filmInThe Bad Man(1941)After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan drove himself to Iowa, where he held jobs as an announcer at several stations. He moved toWHOradio inDes Moinesas an announcer forChicago Cubsbaseball games. His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using as his source only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress.[19]While traveling with the Cubs in California, Reagan took a screen test in 1937 that led to a seven-year contract withWarner Brothersstudios.[20]He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the "B film" unit, where, Reagan joked, the producers "didn't want them good, they wanted them Thursday".[21]Play mediaReagan inKings Row, which gave a brief boost to his career, in 1942. Trailer from the film.His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movieLove Is on the Air, and by the end of 1939 he had already appeared in 19 films,[22]includingDark VictorywithBette DavisandHumphrey Bogart. Before the filmSanta Fe TrailwithErrol Flynnin 1940, he played the role ofGeorge "The Gipper" Gippin the filmKnute Rockne, All American; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname "the Gipper".[23]In 1941 exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.[24]Reagan's favorite acting role was as a double amputee in 1942'sKings Row,[25]in which he recites the line, "Where's the rest of me?", later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Many film critics consideredKings Rowto be his best movie,[26]though the film was condemned byNew York TimescriticBosley Crowther.[27][28]Although Reagan calledKings Rowthe film that "made me a star",[29]he was unable to capitalize on his success because he was ordered to active duty with the U.S. Army at San Francisco two months after its release, and never regained "star" status in motion pictures.[29]In the post-war era, after being separated from almost four years of World War II stateside service with the 1st Motion Picture Unit in December 1945, Reagan co-starred in such films as,The Voice of the Turtle,John Loves Mary,The Hasty Heart,Bedtime for Bonzo,Cattle Queen of Montana,Tennessee's Partner,Hellcats of the Navy(the only film in which he appears with Nancy Reagan) and the 1964 remakeThe Killers(his final film and the only one in which he played a villain).[30]Throughout his film career, his mother answered much of his fan mail.[31]Military serviceWith wifeJane Wymanin 1942After completing fourteen home-study Army Extension Courses, Reagan enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps of the cavalry on May 25, 1937.[32]Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time on April 18, 1942. Due to his poor eyesight, he was classified for limited service only, which excluded him from serving overseas.[33]His first assignment was at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation atFort Mason, California, as a liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office.[34]Upon the approval of theArmy Air Force(AAF), he applied for a transfer from the cavalry to the AAF on May 15, 1942, and was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to theFirst Motion Picture Unit(officially, the "18th Army Air Force Base Unit") inCulver City, California.[34]On January 14, 1943, he was promoted tofirst lieutenantand was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit ofThis Is The ArmyatBurbank, California.[34]He returned to the First Motion Picture Unit after completing this duty and was promoted tocaptainon July 22, 1943.[35]In January 1944, Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the opening of theSixth War Loan Drive. He was reassigned to the First Motion Picture Unit on November 14, 1944, where he remained until the end of World War II.[35]He was recommended for promotion tomajoron February 2, 1945, but this recommendation was disapproved on July 17 of that year.[36]While with the First Motion Picture Unit in 1945, he was indirectly involved in discovering actressMarilyn Monroe.[37]He returned toFort MacArthur, California, where he was separated from active duty on December 9, 1945.[36]By the end of the war, his units had produced some 400 training films for the AAF.[35]Reagan never left the United States during the war, though he kept a film reel, obtained while in the service, depicting the liberation of Auschwitz, as he believed that someday doubts would arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred.[38]It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign ministerYitzhak Shamirin 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz,[38][39]though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz.[40]SAG presidentTelevision star Ronald Reagan as the host ofGeneral Electric TheaterGuest stars for the premiere episode ofThe Dick Powell Show, "Who Killed Julie Greer?"

Seated, from left,Carolyn JonesandDick Powell.Reagan was first elected to the Board of Directors of theScreen Actors Guildin 1941, serving as an alternate. After World War II, he resumed service and became 3rd vice-president in 1946.[41]The adoption of conflict-of-interest bylaws in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and subsequently elected.[41]He was subsequently chosen by the membership to serve seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959.[41]Reagan led SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor-management disputes, theTaft-Hartley Act,House Committee on Un-American Activities(HUAC) hearings and theHollywood blacklistera.[41]Secret FBI informant in HollywoodDuring the late 1940s, Reagan and his wife provided theFBIwith names of actors within the motion picture industry whom they believed to becommunist sympathizers, though he expressed reservations; he said "Do they expect us to constitute ourselves as a little FBI of our own and determine just who is a Commie and who isn't?".[42]Reagan testified before theHouse Un-American Activities Committeeon the subject as well.[43]A ferventanti-communist, he reaffirmed his commitment to democratic principles, stating, "I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment."[43]TelevisionThough an early critic of television, Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and decided to join the medium.[21]He was hired as the host ofGeneral Electric Theater, a series of weekly dramas that became very popular.[21]His contract required him to tour GE plants sixteen weeks out of the year, often demanding of him fourteen speeches per day.[21]He earned approximately $125,000 per year (about $1.07&#160;million in 2010 dollars) in this role. His final work as a professional actor was as host and performer from 1964 to 1965 on the television seriesDeath Valley Days.[44]Reagan and Nancy Davis appeared together several times, including an episode ofGeneral Electric Theaterin 1958 called "A Turkey for the President".[45]Marriages and childrenMatron of honorBrenda Marshalland best manWilliam Holden, sole guests at Ronald andNancy Reagan's wedding in 1952.In 1938, Reagan co-starred in the filmBrother Ratwith actressJane Wyman(1917&ndash;2007). They were engaged at theChicago Theatre,[46]and married on January 26, 1940, at theWee Kirk o' the Heather churchinGlendale, California.[47]Together they had two biological children,Maureen(1941&ndash;2001) and Christine (who was born in 1947 but only lived one day), and adopted a third,Michael(born 1945).[48]After arguments about Reagan's political ambitions, Wyman filed for divorce in 1948,[49]citing a distraction due to her husband's Screen Actors Guild union duties; the divorce was finalized in 1949.[23]He is the only US president to have been divorced.[50]Reagan and Wyman continued to be friends until his death, with Wyman voting for Reagan in both of his runs and, upon his death, saying "America has lost a great president and a great, kind, and gentle man."[51]Ronald andNancy Reaganaboard a boat in California in 1964Reagan met actressNancy Davis(born 1921)[52]in 1949 after she contacted him in his capacity as president of the Screen Actors Guild to help her with issues regarding her name appearing on a Communist blacklist in Hollywood. She had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis. She described their meeting by saying, "I don't know if it was exactly love at first sight, but it was pretty close."[53]They were engaged atChasen'srestaurant in Los Angeles and were married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in theSan Fernando Valley.[54]ActorWilliam Holdenserved as best man at the ceremony. They had two children:Patti(born October 21, 1952) andRon(born May 20, 1958).Observers described the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate.[55]During his presidency they were reported to frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting."[53][56]He often called her "Mommy" and she called him "Ronnie".[56]He once wrote to her, "Whatever I treasure and enjoy&#160;... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you."[57]When he was in the hospital in 1981, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent.[58]In a letter to U.S. citizens written in 1994, Reagan wrote "I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted withAlzheimer's disease.... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience",[53]and in 1998, while Reagan was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy toldVanity Fair, "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him."[53]Early political career, 1948&ndash;67Reagan began his political career as aDemocrat. He joined numerous political committees with a left-wing orientation, such as the American Veterans Committee. He fought against Republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and forHelen Gahagan Douglasin 1950, when shewas defeated for the SenatebyRichard Nixon. It was his realization that Communists were a powerful backstage influence in those groups, that led him to rally his friends against them.[59]Reagan spoke frequently at rallies with a strong ideological dimension; in December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the Warner Bros. studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency, specifically his opposition tomutually assured destruction, building on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to a new focus to reduce the numbers and types of them.[60]In the 1948 election, Reagan strongly supportedHarry S. Truman, appearing on stage with him during a campaign speech in Los Angeles.[61]However, in the early 1950s, as his relationship with actress Nancy Davis grew,[62]he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies ofDwight D. Eisenhowerin 1952 and 1956 as well as Richard Nixon in 1960.[63]He was hired by General Electric in 1954 to host theGeneral Electric Theater, a weekly TV drama series. Much more important, he crisscrossed the country giving talks to over 200,000 GE employees as a motivational speaker.His many speeches&mdash;which he wrote himself&mdash;were non-partisan but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced byLemuel Boulware, a senior GE executive. Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism: free markets, anticommunism, lower taxes, and limited government.[64]Eager for a larger stage, but not allowed to enter politics by GE, he quit and formally registered as a Republican.[65]He often said "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me".[66]When legislation that would becomeMedicarewas introduced in 1961, Reagan created a recording for theAmerican Medical Associationwarning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, "we will awake to find that we have socialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."[67][68]He also joined theNational Rifle Associationand would become a lifetime member.[69]Reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contenderBarry Goldwaterin 1964.[70]Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. Consolidating themes he had developed in talks for GE, he argued in "A Time for Choosing" (October 27, 1964):The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing....You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream &ndash; the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order &ndash; or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism."[71][72]This "A Time for Choosing" speech was not enough to turn around the faltering Goldwater campaign, but it was the key event that established Reagan's national political visibility.[73][74]Governor of California (1967&ndash;75)Main article:Governorship of Ronald ReaganRonald and Nancy Reagan celebrate his gubernatorial victory at the Biltmore Hotel in Los AngelesCalifornia Republicans were impressed with Reagan's political views and charisma after his "Time for Choosing" speech,[75]he announced in late 1965, his campaign forGovernor of Californiain 1966.[76][77]He defeated former San Francisco mayorGeorge Christopherin the GOP primary. In Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: "to send the welfare bums back to work", and, in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishmentstudent protestsat theUniversity of California at Berkeley, "to clean up the mess at Berkeley".[78]Ronald Reagan accomplished in 1966 what US SenatorWilliam F. Knowlandin 1958 and former Vice-PresidentRichard M. Nixonin 1962 had tried: he was elected, defeating two-term governorEdmund G. "Pat" Brown, and was sworn in on January 2, 1967. In his first term, he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget.[79]Shortly after the beginning of his term, Reagan tested thepresidential waters in 1968as part of a "Stop Nixon" movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's Southern support[80]and be a compromise candidate[81]if neither Nixon nor second-placeNelson Rockefellerreceived enough delegates to win on the first ballot at theRepublican convention. However, by the time of the convention Nixon had 692 delegate votes, 25 more than he needed to secure the nomination, followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place.[80]Reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era. On May 15, 1969, during thePeople's Park protestsat UC Berkeley, Reagan sent theCalifornia Highway Patroland other officers to quell the protests, in an incident that became known as "Bloody Thursday", resulting in the death of student James Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard.[82][83]Reagan then called out 2,200state National Guardtroops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters.[82]A year after "Bloody Thursday", Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying, "If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement."[84]When theSymbionese Liberation ArmykidnappedPatty Hearstin Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked to a group of political aides about abotulismoutbreak contaminating the food.[85]Conversely, in that one afternoon, "Bloody Thursday", 111 police officers were injured, including one C.H.P. officer who was knifed in the chest. After calling in the National Guard, the Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days, camping in People's Park, and demonstrations subsided as the University removed cordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for People's Park on hold.[82][86]The Reagans meeting with PresidentRichard Nixonand First LadyPat Nixonin July 1970Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was beginning. Democratic California state senatorAnthony Beilensonintroduced the "Therapeutic Abortion Act", in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.[82]The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it.[87]About two million abortions would be performed as a result, most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.[87]Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor, he would not have signed it. After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he waspro-life.[87]He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.[88]In 1967, Reagan signed theMulford Act, which becameCalifornia penal code12031and171(c). The bill repealed a law allowingpublic carryingof loaded firearms. Named afterRepublicanassemblymanDon Mulford, the bill garnered national attention after theBlack Panthersmarched bearing arms upon theCalifornia State Capitolto protest the bill.[89][90]Despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968,[91]Reagan was re-elected in 1970, defeating "Big Daddy"Jesse Unruh. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment, which he strongly supported.[25]His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when theSupreme Court of Californiaissued itsPeople v. Andersondecision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California before 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, whenAaron Mitchell's sentence was carried out by the state inSan Quentin's gas chamber.[92]In 1969, Reagan, as Governor, signed theFamily Law Act, an amalgam of two bills which had been written and revised by theCalifornia state legislaturefor over two years[93]and became the firstno-fault divorcelegislation in the United States.[94]Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work", he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.[95]Reagan did not seek re-election to a third term as governor in 1974 and was succeeded by DemocraticCalifornia Secretary of StateJerry Brownon January 6, 1975.1976 presidential campaignMain article:Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1976Ronald Reagan on the podium with Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention after narrowly losing the presidential nomination.In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent PresidentGerald Fordin a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as theAmerican Conservative Unionwhich became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.[96]Reagan's campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign managerJohn Searsof winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as[97]he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois.[98]The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all ninety-six delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, includingErnest Angelo, the mayor ofMidland, andRay BarnhartofHouston, whom President Reagan would appoint in 1981 as director of theFederal Highway Administration.[99]However, as the GOPconventionneared, Ford appeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate SenatorRichard Schweikerof Pennsylvania as hisrunning mateif nominated. Nonetheless, Ford prevailed with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.[98]Ford would go on to lose the1976 Presidential electionto the DemocratJimmy Carter.Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from afaithless electorin the November election from the state of Washington,[100]which Ford had won over Democratic challengerJimmy Carter.After the campaign, Reagan remained in the public debate with the Ronald Reagan Radio Commentary series[101]and his political action committee,Citizens for the Republic, which was later revived inAlexandria,Virginiain 2009 by the Reagan biographerCraig Shirley.[102]1980 presidential campaignMain articles:Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980andUnited States presidential election, 1980Reagan campaigns with Nancy and SenatorStrom Thurmond(right) in South Carolina, 1980The 1980 presidential campaign between Reagan and incumbent PresidentJimmy Carterwas conducted during domestic concerns and the ongoingIran hostage crisis. His campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to stimulate the economy,[103]less government interference in people's lives,[104]states' rights,[105]and a strong national defense.[106]Reagan launched his campaign by declaring "I believe in states' rights." After receiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected one of his primary opponents,George H.W. Bush, to be his running mate. His showing in the Octobertelevised debateboosted his campaign. Reagan won the election, carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.). Reagan received 50.7% of the popular vote while Carter took 41%, and IndependentJohn B. Anderson(a liberal Republican) received 6.7%.[107]Republicans captured the Senatefor the first time since 1952, andgained 34 House seats, but the Democrats retained a majority.Presidency (1981&ndash;89)Main articles:Electoral history of Ronald Reagan,Domestic policy of the Ronald Reagan administration,Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration,Presidency of Ronald ReaganandReagan DoctrineThe Reagan presidency began in a dramatic manner; on January 20, 1981, as Reagan was giving his inaugural address,52 U.S. hostages, held by Iran for 444 days, were set free.During his presidency, Reagan pursued policies that reflected his personal belief in individual freedom, brought changes domestically, both to the U.S. economy and expanded military, and contributed to the end of theCold War.[108]Termed theReagan Revolution, his presidency would reinvigorate American morale,[109][110]reinvigorate the American economy and reduce American reliance upon government.[108]As president, Reagan kept a diary in which he commented on daily occurrences of his presidency and his views on the issues of the day. The diaries were published in May 2007 in the bestselling book,The Reagan Diaries.[111]First term, 1981&ndash;85To date, Reagan is the oldest person elected to the office of the presidency (at 69) and the oldest president at the time of inauguration (at 69 years, 341 days). In hisfirst inaugural addresson January 20, 1981, which Reagan himself wrote, he addressed the country's economic malaise arguing: "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem".[112]Prayer in schools and a moment of silenceIn 1981, Reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer. Theschool prayerhad previously beenbanned by the supreme court in 1962, and Reagan's election reflected an opposition to the courts decision.[113]Reagan's 1981 proposed amendment stated: "Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public institutions. No person shall be required by the United States or by any state to participate in prayer." In a message to Congress, Reagan said that his proposed amendment would "restore the simple freedom of our citizens to offer prayer in public schools and institutions."[114]In a nationally televised speech the following day, RabbiMenachem M. Schneersonlauded Reagan's speech and said the moment of silence would "ensure that children grow up to be decent and upright."[115]In 1984, Reagan again raised the issue, asking Congress "why can't [the] freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land?"[116]In 1985, Reagan expressed his disappointment that the Supreme Court ruling still bans a moment of silence for public-school, and said he had "an uphill battle."[117]In 1987 Reagan again renewed his call for Congress to support voluntary prayer in schools and end "the expulsion of God from America's classrooms."[118]During his term in office, Reagan campaigned vigorously to restore prayer to the schools, first as a moment of prayer and later as a Moment of Silence.[119]Assassination attemptMain article:Attempted assassination of Ronald ReaganOn March 30, 1981, only 69 days into the new administration, Reagan, his press secretaryJames Brady, Washington police officerThomas Delahanty, and Secret Service agentTimothy McCarthywere struck by gunfire from would-be assassinJohn Hinckley Jr., outside theWashington Hilton Hotel. Although "close to death" upon arrival atGeorge Washington University Hospital, Reagan was stabilized in the emergency room, then underwent emergency exploratory surgery.[120]He recovered and was released from the hospital on April 11, becoming the first serving U.S. President to survive being shot in an assassination attempt.[121]The attempt had great influence on Reagan's popularity; polls indicated his approval rating to be around 73%.[122]Reagan believed that God had spared his life so that he might go on to fulfill a greater purpose.[123]Assistant Secretary of State nominationIn response to conservative criticism that the state department lacked hardliners, Reagan in 1981 nominatedErnest W. LefeverasAssistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. Lefever performed poorly at his confirmation hearings and the Senate committee rejected his nomination by vote of 4-13; Lefever withdrew his name.[124]Air traffic controllers' strikeMain article:Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)In summer 1981 PATCO, the union offederal air traffic controllers went on strike, violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking.[125]Declaring the situation an emergency as described in the 1947Taft&ndash;Hartley Act, Reagan stated that if the air traffic controllers "do not report for work within 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated".[126]They did not return and on August 5, Reagan fired 11,345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his order, and used supervisors and military controllers to handle the nation's commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained.[127]A leading reference work on public administration concluded, "The firing of PATCO employees not only demonstrated a clear resolve by the president to take control of the bureaucracy, but it also sent a clear message to the private sector that unions no longer needed to be feared".[128]"Reaganomics" and the economyMain article:ReaganomicsDuringJimmy Carter's last year in office (1980), inflation averaged 12.5%, compared with 4.4% during Reagan's last year in office (1988).[129]During Reagan's administration, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% to 5.4%, with the rate reaching highs of 10.8% in 1982 and 10.4% in 1983, averaging 7.5% over the eight years, and real GDP growth averaged 3.44% with a high of 8.55% in 1983, while nominal GDP growth averaged 7.4%, and peaked at 12.2% in 1982.[130][131][132]Reagan gives a televised address from theOval Office, outlining his plan for Tax Reduction Legislation in July 1981.Reagan implemented policies based onsupply-side economics, advocating alaissez-fairephilosophy andfree-marketfiscal policy,[133]seeking to stimulate the economy with large, across-the-boardtax cuts.[134][135]He also supported returning the United States to some sort ofgold standard, and successfully urged Congress to establish the U.S. Gold Commission to study how one could be implemented. Citing the economic theories ofArthur Laffer, Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a theory that entered political discussion as theLaffer curve. Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of "peace through strength" resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.[136]During Reagan's presidency, federalincome tax rateswere lowered significantly with the signing of theEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981[137]which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%, however other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan, ensured that tax revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period 1970&ndash;2010.[138]Then, in 1982 theJob Training Partnership Act of 1982was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' firstpublic-private partnershipsand a major part of the president'sjob creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff,Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.Conversely, Congress passed and Reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs asTax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982(TEFRA),Social Security, and theDeficit Reduction Act of 1984(DEFRA).[139][140]Despite the fact that TEFRA was the "largest peacetime tax increase in American history",[140][141][142][143]gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after theearly 1980s recessionended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office at an annual rate of 7.91% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981.[144]Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982&mdash;higher than any time since the Great Depression&mdash;then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency.[145]Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased.[146]TheTax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption,standard deduction, andearned income tax credit. The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.[147][148]The net effect of all Reagan-era tax bills was a 1% decrease in government revenues when compared to Treasury Department revenue estimates from the Administration's first post-enactment January budgets.[149]However, federal income tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989, rising from $308.7 billion to $549 billion[150]or an average annual rate of 8.2% (2.5% attributed to higher Social Security receipts), and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of 7.1%.[151][152]President Reagan delivers a special address to Congress on the Program for Economic Recovery from the U.S. Capitol, April 28, 1981, a few weeks after surviving anassassination attempt.Reagan's policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment,[153]which would then lead to higher employment and wages. Critics labeled this "trickle-down economics"&mdash;the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a "trickle-down" effect to the poor.[154]Questions arose whether Reagan's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty,[155]and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles.[155]These views were exacerbated by the fact that Reagan's economic regimen included freezing theminimum wageat $3.35 an hour, slashingfederal assistance to local governmentsby 60%, cutting the budget forpublic housingandSection 8 rent subsidiesin half, and eliminating the antipovertyCommunity Development Block Grantprogram.[156]The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan's economic policies took effect.[157]Along with Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income, he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20%.[158]Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%.[159]Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility.[160]According toPaul Krugman, "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger thanMr.&#160;Clinton's 1993 tax increase".[161]According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.[162]Further following his opposition to government intervention, Reagan cut the budgets of non-military[163]programs[164]includingMedicaid,food stamps, federal education programs[163]and theEPA.[165]While he protected entitlement programs, such asSocial SecurityandMedicare,[166]his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the Social Security disability rolls.[167]The administration's stance toward theSavings and Loanindustry contributed to thesavings and loan crisis.[168]It is also suggested, by a minority of Reaganomics critics, that the policies partially influenced thestock market crash of 1987,[169]but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash.[170]In order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits, the United States borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad, raising thenational debtfrom $997&#160;billion to $2.85&#160;trillion.[171]Reagan described the new debt as the "greatest disappointment" of his presidency.[146]He reappointedPaul VolckerasChairman of the Federal Reserve, and in 1987 he appointed monetaristAlan Greenspanto succeed him. Reagan ended theprice controlson domestic oil which had contributed to energy crises in the early 1970s.[172][173]The price of oil subsequently dropped, and the 1980s did not see the fuel shortages that the 1970s had.[174]Reagan also fulfilled a 1980 campaign promise to repeal thewindfall profit taxin 1988, which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil.[175]Some economists, such as Nobel Prize winnersMilton FriedmanandRobert A. Mundell, argue that Reagan's tax policies invigorated America's economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s.[176]Other economists, such as Nobel Prize winnerRobert Solow, argue that Reagan's deficits were a major reason his successor, George H.W. Bush, reneged on acampaign promiseand resorted to raising taxes.[176]During Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within theU.S. intelligence communityto ensure America's economic strength. The program,Project Socrates, developed and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage&mdash;automated innovation. To ensure that the United States acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan, during his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nationwide basis. However, Reagan's term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration, labeling Project Socrates as "industrial policy", had it terminated.[177][178]Escalation of the Cold WarSee also:Cold WarandCold War (1979&ndash;85)Reagan escalated the Cold War, accelerating a reversal from the policy ofdétentewhich began in 1979 after theSoviet war in Afghanistan.[179]Reagan ordered a massive buildup of theUnited States Armed Forces[136]and implemented new policies towards the Soviet Union: reviving theB-1 Lancerprogram that had been canceled by theCarter administration, and producing theMX missile.[180]In response to Soviet deployment of theSS-20, Reagan oversawNATO's deployment of thePershing missilein West Germany.[181]Reagan, the first American president ever to address theBritish Parliament, predicts Marxism&ndash;Leninism will be left on theash heap of historyon June 8, 1982.[182]Together with the United Kingdom's prime ministerMargaret Thatcher, Reagan denounced the Soviet Union in ideological terms.[183]In a famous address on June 8, 1982, to theBritish Parliamentin the Royal Gallery of thePalace of Westminster, Reagan said, "the forward march of freedom and democracy will leaveMarxism&ndash;Leninismon theash heap of history".[184][185]On March 3, 1983, he predicted that communism would collapse, stating, "Communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written".[186]In a speech to theNational Association of Evangelicalson March 8, 1983, Reagan called the Soviet Union "anevil empire".[187]After Soviet fighters downedKorean Air Lines Flight 007nearMoneron Islandon September 1, 1983, carrying 269 people, including Georgia congressmanLarry McDonald, Reagan labeled the act a "massacre" and declared that the Soviets had turned "against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere".[188]The Reagan administration responded to the incident by suspending all Soviet passenger air service to the United States, and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the Soviets, wounding them financially.[188]As result of the shootdown, and the cause of KAL 007's going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its navigational system, Reagan announced on September 16, 1983, that theGlobal Positioning Systemwould be made available for civilian use, free of charge, once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in future.[189][190]President Reagan meeting withAfghan Mujahideenleaders in theOval Officein 1983Under a policy that came to be known as theReagan Doctrine, Reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid toanti-communistresistance movementsin an effort to "rollback" Soviet-backed communist governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.[191]Reagan deployed the CIA'sSpecial Activities Divisionto Afghanistan and Pakistan. They were instrumental in training, equipping and leadingMujaheddinforces against theSoviet Army.[192][193]President Reagan's Covert Action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan,[194]though some of the United States funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat to U.S. troops in the 2000s (decade)war in Afghanistan.[195]However, in a break from the Carter policy of arming Taiwan under theTaiwan Relations Act, Reagan also agreed with the communist government in China toreduce the sale of arms to Taiwan.[196]In March 1983, Reagan introduced theStrategic Defense Initiative, a defense project[197]that would have used ground- and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles.[198]Reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible.[197][199]There was much disbelief surrounding the program's scientific feasibility, leading opponents to dub SDI "Star Wars" and argue that its technological objective was unattainable.[197]The Soviets became concerned about the possible effects SDI would have;[200]leaderYuri Andropovsaid it would put "the entire world in jeopardy".[201]For those reasons,David Gergen, former aide to President Reagan, believes that in retrospect, SDI hastened the end of the Cold War.[202]Critics labeled Reagan's foreign policies as aggressive, imperialistic, and chided them as "warmongering", though they were supported by leadingAmerican conservativeswho argued that they were necessary to protect U.S. security interests.[200]The Reagan administration also backed anti-communist leaders accused of severe human rights violations, such asEfraín Ríos MonttofGuatemala.[203][204]Lebanese Civil War (1983)Main article:Beirut barracks bombingWith the approval of Congress, Reagan in 1983 sentforcesto Lebanon to reduce the threat of theLebanese Civil War. The Americanpeacekeeping forcesinBeirut, a part ofa multinational forceduring theLebanese Civil War, were attacked on October 23, 1983. TheBeirut barracks bombingkilled241 American servicemenand wounded more than 60 others by a suicide truck bomber.[205]Reagan sent inUSS New Jersey (BB-62)battleshipto shell Syrian positions in Lebanon. He then withdrew all theMarinesfromLebanon.[206]Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada, 1983)Main article:Invasion of GrenadaReagan meets with Prime MinisterEugenia Charlesof Dominica in theOval Officeabout ongoing events in Grenada.On October 25, 1983, Reagan ordered U.S. forces to invade Grenada, code namedOperation Urgent Fury, where a 1979coup d'étathad established an independentnon-alignedMarxist&ndash;Leninistgovernment. A formal appeal from theOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States(OECS) led to the intervention of U.S. forces; President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St.&#160;George's University as adequate reasons to invade.Operation Urgent Furywas the first major military operation conducted by U.S. forces since theVietnam War, several days of fighting commenced, resulting in a U.S. victory,[207]with 19 American fatalities and 116 wounded American soldiers.[208]In mid-December, after a new government was appointed by the Governor-General, U.S. forces withdrew.[207]1984 presidential campaignMain article:United States presidential election, 19841984 presidential electoral votes by state. Reagan (red) won every state except for Washington, D.C., and Mondale's home state ofMinnesota.Reagan accepted the Republican nomination inDallas, Texas. He proclaimed that it was "morning again in America", regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U.S. athletes at the1984 Summer Olympics, among other things.[21]He became the first American president to open an Olympic Games held in the United States.[209]Reagan's opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice PresidentWalter Mondale. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he hadAlzheimer's disease.[210][211]Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience", which generated applause and laughter, even from Mondale himself.[212]That November, Reagan was re-elected, winning 49 of 50 states.[213]The president's overwhelming victory saw Mondale carry only his home state of Minnesota (by 3,800 votes) and the District of Columbia. Reagan won a record 525 electoral votes, the most of any candidate in United States history,[214]and received 58.8% of the popular vote to Mondale's 40.6%.[213]Second term, 1985&ndash;89Ronald Reagan is sworn in for a second term as president in the Capitol RotundaReagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at theWhite House. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in theCapitol Rotundathe following day. January 21 was one of thecoldest days on recordin Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat, movingWhite House Chief of StaffJames Bakerto Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury SecretaryDonald Regan, a formerMerrill Lynchofficer, Chief of Staff.[215][215]In 1985, Reagan visited a German military cemetery inBitburgto lay a wreath with West German ChancellorHelmut Kohl. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty-nine members of theWaffen-SS. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves "victims", a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims ofthe Holocaust;Pat Buchanan, Reagan's Director of Communications, argued that the president did not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust.[216]Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,[217]the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl. He ultimately attended the ceremony where two military generals laid a wreath.[218]Play mediaReagan addresses the nation after the Challenger disasterThe disintegration of theSpace Shuttle Challengeron January 28, 1986, proved a pivotal moment in Reagan's presidency. All sevenastronautsaboard were killed.[219]On the night of the disaster, Reagan delivered a speech, written byPeggy Noonan, in which he said:The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave...We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of Earth' to 'touch the face of God.'[220]In 1988, near the end of theIran&ndash;Iraq War, the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiserUSSVincennesaccidentally shot downIran Air Flight 655killing 290 civilian passengers. The incident further worsened already tenseIran&ndash;United States relations.[221]War on DrugsMain article:War on DrugsReagan announced aWar on Drugsin 1982, in response to concerns about the increasingcrack epidemic. Though Nixon had previously declared a war on drugs, Reagan advocated more militant policies.[222]He said that "drugs were menacing our society" and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.[223][224]In 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted $1.7&#160;billion to fund the War on Drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.[225]The bill was criticized for promoting significantracial disparities in the prison population[225]and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street, while resulting in a great financial burden for America.[226]Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use.[227][228]First LadyNancy Reaganmade the War on Drugs her main priority by founding the "Just Say No" drug awareness campaign, which aimed to discourage children and teenagers from engaging inrecreational drug useby offering various ways of saying "no". Nancy Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states, raising awareness about the dangers of drugs including alcohol.[229]Libya bombingMain article:1986 Bombing of LibyaUK Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher, seen here with Reagan outside10 Downing Street, London in June 1982, granted the U.S. use of British airbases to launch the Libya attackRelations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with theGulf of Sidra incidentin 1981; by 1982, Libyan leaderMuammar Gaddafiwas considered by the CIA to be, along with USSR leaderLeonid Brezhnevand Cuban leaderFidel Castro, part of a group known as the "unholy trinity" and was also labeled as "our international public enemy number one" by a CIA official.[230]These tensions were later revived in early April 1986, whena bomb exploded in a Berlin discothčque, resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman. Stating that there was "irrefutable proof" that Libya had directed the "terrorist bombing", Reagan authorized the use of force against the country. In the late evening of April 15, 1986, the United States launched a series ofair strikeson ground targets in Libya.[231][232]The UK Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcherallowed the U.S. Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch the attack, on the justification that the UK was supporting America's right to self-defense under Article 51 of theUnited Nations Charter.[232]The attack was designed to halt Gaddafi's "ability to export terrorism", offering him "incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior".[231]The president addressed the nation from theOval Officeafter the attacks had commenced, stating, "When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long as I'm in this office".[232]The attack was condemned by many countries. By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions, theUnited Nations General Assemblyadopted resolution 41/38 which "condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on April 15, 1986, which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law".[233]ImmigrationReagan signed theImmigration Reform and Control Actin 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruitillegal immigrants, required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and grantedamnestyto approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration.[234]Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbishedStatue of Liberty, Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans."[235]Reagan also said, "The employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element. It will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here."[235]Iran&ndash;Contra affairMain articles:Iran&ndash;Contra affair,Reagan administration scandalsandNicaragua v. United StatesPresident Reagan receives the Tower Report in theCabinet Roomof the White House in 1987.In 1986, theIran-Contra affairbecame a problem for the administration stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during theIran&ndash;Iraq Warto fund theContrarebelsfighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress.[236][237]TheIran&ndash;Contra affairbecame apolitical scandalin the United States during the 1980s.[238]TheInternational Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States,[239]ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways (seeNicaragua v. United States).[240][241]President Reagan professed that he was unaware of the plot's existence. He opened his own investigation and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower,Brent ScowcroftandEdmund Muskie, known as the "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible.[242]A separate report by Congress concluded that "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have".[242]Reagan's popularity declined from 67% to 46% in less than a week, the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president.[243]The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff, and eleven convictions.[244]Many Central Americans criticize Reagan for his support of the Contras, calling him an anti-communist zealot, blinded to human rights abuses, while others say he "saved Central America".[245]Daniel Ortega,Sandinistanand president of Nicaragua, said that he hoped God would forgive Reagan for his "dirty war against Nicaragua".[245]End of the Cold WarSee also:Cold War (1985&ndash;91)Ronald Reagan speaks at theBerlin Wall'sBrandenburg Gate, challengingGorbachevto "tear down this wall!!"Until the early 1980s, the United States had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed.[246]Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's military buildup,[247]their large military expenses, in combination withcollectivized agricultureand inefficientplanned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for theSoviet economy.[248]At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production,[249]which resulted in a drop of oil prices in 1985 to one-third of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues.[248]These factors contributed to a stagnant Soviet economy duringGorbachev's tenure.[248]Reagan recognized the change in the direction of the Soviet leadership withMikhail Gorbachev, and shifted to diplomacy, with a view to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements.[250]Reagan's personal mission was to achieve "a world free of nuclear weapons", which he regarded as "totally irrational, totally inhumane, good for nothing but killing, possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization".[251][252][253]He was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with General Secretary Gorbachev.[253]Gorbachev and Reagan heldfour summit conferencesbetween 1985 and 1988: thefirstinGeneva, Switzerland, thesecondinReykjavík,Iceland, the third in Washington, D.C., and the fourth in Moscow.[254]Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, this would lead to reform and the end of Communism.[255]Speaking at theBerlin Wallon June 12, 1987, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further, saying "General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev,tear down this wall!"Gorbachev and Reagan sign theINF Treatyat the White House in 1987Before Gorbachev's visit to Washington, D.C., for the third summit in 1987, the Soviet leader announced his intention to pursue significant arms agreements.[256]The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe.[256]He and Reagan signed theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treatyat the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.[257]The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, orSTART I; Reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.[252]When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988, he was viewed as a celebrity by the Soviets. A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire. "No", he replied, "I was talking about another time, another era".[258]At Gorbachev's request, Reagan gave a speech on free markets at theMoscow State University.[259]In his autobiography,An American Life, Reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted and his warm feelings for Gorbachev.[260]In November 1989, ten months after Reagan left office, theBerlin Wallwastorn down, the Cold War was officially declared over at theMalta Summiton December 3, 1989, and two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.[261]HealthEarly in his presidency, Reagan started wearing a custom, technologically advancedhearing aid, first in his right ear[262]and later in his left as well.[263]His decision to go public in 1983 regarding his wearing the small, audio-amplifying device boosted their sales.[264]On July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery atBethesda Naval Hospitalto remove cancerouspolypsfrom hiscolon. He relinquished presidential power to the Vice President for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the25th Amendment, which he specifically avoided invoking.[265]The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful.[266]Reagan resumed the powers of the presidency later that day.[267]In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose.[268]In October, additional skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.[269]In January 1987, Reagan underwent surgery for an enlargedprostatewhich caused further worries about his health. No cancerous growths were found, however, and he was not sedated during the operation.[270]In July of that year, aged 76, he underwent a third skin cancer operation on his nose.[271]JudiciaryMain articles:Ronald Reagan Supreme Court candidatesandRonald Reagan judicial appointmentsDuring his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, if given the opportunity, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice.[272]That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominatedSandra Day O'Connorto fill the vacancy created by the retirement of JusticePotter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevatedWilliam Rehnquistto succeedWarren BurgerasChief Justice, and namedAntonin Scaliato fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative juristRobert Borkto the high court in 1987. SenatorTed Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued.[273]Bork's nomination was rejected 58&ndash;42.[274]Reagan then nominatedDouglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for hiscannabisuse.[275]Anthony Kennedywas eventually confirmed in his place.[276]Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to theUnited States Courts of Appeals, and 290 judges to theUnited States district courts.Reagan also nominatedVaughn R. Walker, who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge,[277]to theUnited States District Court for the Central District of California. However, the nomination stalled in the Senate, and Walker was not confirmed until he was renominated by Reagan's successor, George H.&#160;W. Bush.[278]Early in his tenure, Reagan appointedClarence M. Pendleton, Jr., ofSan Diegoas the first African American to chair theUnited States Commission on Civil Rights. Pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with Reagan's views on social and civil rights policy during his time as tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed thecomparable worthproposal as being "Looney Tunes".[279][280][281]In 1984, Reagancommutedthe 18-year sentence of formerLouisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and ForestryGil Dozier, a Democrat fromBaton Rouge, to the time served for violations of both theHobbsand theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizationsacts. On September 23, 1980, theUnited States District Court for the Middle District of Louisianaconvicted Dozier ofextortionandracketeeringwhen he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf.[282]Reagan determined that the 18-year sentence was excessive compared to what other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving.[283][284]Post-presidency (1989&ndash;2004)Ronald and Nancy Reagan in Los Angeles after leaving the White House, early 1990sAfter leaving office in 1989, the Reagans purchased a home inBel Air, Los Angelesin addition to theReagan RanchinSanta Barbara. They regularly attendedBel Air Presbyterian Church[285]and occasionally made appearances on behalf of the Republican Party; Reagan delivered a well-received speech at the1992 Republican National Convention.[286]Previously on November 4, 1991, theRonald Reagan Presidential Librarywas dedicated and opened to the public. At the dedication ceremonies, five presidents were in attendance, as well as six first ladies, marking the first time that five presidents were gathered in the same location.[287]Reagan continued publicly to speak in favor of aline-item veto; theBrady Bill;[288]aconstitutional amendmentrequiring abalanced budget; and the repeal of the22nd Amendment, which prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president.[289]In 1992 Reagan established theRonald Reagan Freedom Awardwith the newly formed Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.[290]His final public speech was on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C., and his last major public appearance was at thefuneralofRichard Nixonon April 27, 1994.Alzheimer's diseaseAnnouncement and reactionIn August 1994, at the age of 83, Reagan was diagnosed withAlzheimer's disease,[291]an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells and ultimately causes death.[291][292]In November, he informed the nation through a handwritten letter,[291]writing in part:I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's Disease... At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done... I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead. Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you.[293]After his diagnosis, letters of support from well-wishers poured into his California home.[294]But there was also speculation over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration.[295]FormerCBSWhite House correspondentLesley Stahlrecounted that, in her final meeting with the president in 1986, Reagan did not seem to know who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, but at the end of the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness.[296]However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for theNew York Times, noted that "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy",[297]and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president.[297]Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president "absolutely" did not "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's".[297]Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names.[297]Reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992[298]or 1993,[297]several years after he had left office. His former Chief of StaffJames Bakerconsidered "ludicrous" the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings.[299]Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president.[297]The Reagans with a model ofUSS&#160;Ronald Reagan, May 1996. At left isNewport News ShipbuildingChairman and CEO Bill Fricks.Complicating the picture, Reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, asubdural hematomawas found and surgically treated later in the year.[291][292]Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserts that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease,[292]although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia.[300][301]Reagan's one-time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is possible, but not certain, that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.[298]ProgressionAs the years went on, the disease slowly destroyed Reagan's mental capacity.[297]He was only able to recognize a few people, including his wife, Nancy.[297]He remained active, however; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearbyCentury City.[297]Reagan suffered a fall at his Bel Air home on January 13, 2001, resulting in a broken hip.[302]The fracture was repaired the following day[303]and the 89-year-old Reagan returned home later that week, although he faced difficult physical therapy at home.[304]On February 6, 2001, Reagan reached the age of 90, becoming the third former president to do so (the other two beingJohn AdamsandHerbert Hoover, withGerald Ford,George H.W. BushandJimmy Carterlater reaching 90).[305]Reagan's public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease, and as a result, his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife Nancy. Nancy Reagan told CNN'sLarry Kingin 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that "Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was".[306]After her husband's diagnosis and death, Nancy Reagan became astem-cell researchadvocate, urgingCongressand PresidentGeorge W. Bushto support federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research, something Bush opposed. In 2009, she praised PresidentBarack Obamafor lifting restrictions on such research.[307]Mrs. Reagan has said that she believes that it could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's.[308]DeathMain article:Death and state funeral of Ronald ReaganReagan's casketlying in statein theUnited States Capitol rotundaReagan died ofpneumonia, complicated byAlzheimer's disease,[309]at his home in Bel Air, California, on the afternoon of June 5, 2004.[310]A short time after his death,Nancy Reaganreleased a statement saying, "My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan has died after 10 years of Alzheimer's disease at 93 years of age. We appreciate everyone's prayers."[310]PresidentGeorge W. Bushdeclared June 11 aNational Day of Mourning,[311]andinternational tributescame in from around the world.[312]Reagan's body was taken to the Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica, California later in the day, where well-wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and American flags in the grass.[313]On June 7, his body was removed and taken to theRonald Reagan Presidential Library, where a brief family funeral was held conducted by PastorMichael Wenning. His body lay in repose in the Library lobby until June 9; over 100,000 people viewed the coffin.[314]On June 9, Reagan's body was flown to Washington, D.C. where he became the tenth United States president tolie in state; in thirty-four hours, 104,684 people filed past the coffin.[315]On June 11, astate funeralwas conducted in theWashington National Cathedral, and presided over by President George W. Bush. Eulogies were given by former British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher,[316]former Canadian Prime MinisterBrian Mulroney, and both former PresidentGeorge H.W. Bushand PresidentGeorge W. Bush. Also in attendance wereMikhail Gorbachev, and many world leaders, including British Prime MinisterTony Blair,Prince Charles, representing his motherQueen Elizabeth II, German ChancellorGerhard Schröder, Italian Prime MinisterSilvio Berlusconi, and interim presidentsHamid Karzaiof Afghanistan, andGhazi al-Yawerof Iraq.[317]After the funeral, the Reagan entourage was flown back to the Ronald W. Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, where another service was held, and President Reagan was interred.[318]At the time of his death, Reagan was the longest-lived president in U.S. history, having lived 93 years and 120 days (2 years, 8 months, and 23 days longer thanJohn Adams, whose record he surpassed). He is now the second longest-lived president, just 45 days fewer thanGerald Ford. He was the first United States president to die in the 21st century, and his was the first state funeral in the United States since that of PresidentLyndon B. Johnsonin 1973.His burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered at the opening of theRonald Reagan Presidential Library: "I know in my heart that man is good, that what is right will always eventually triumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life."[319]LegacyRonald Reagan in 1976 at his home atRancho del CieloSince Reagan left office in 1989, substantial debate has occurred among scholars, historians, and the general public surrounding his legacy.[320]Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies,[321]foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War,[322]and a restoration of American pride and morale.[110]Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States,[323]after a decline in American confidence and self-respect underJimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during theIranian hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook for the future of the United States during the 1980 election.[324]Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits,[146]a widergap in wealth, and an increase inhomelessness[156]and that the Iran-Contra affair lowered American credibility.[325]Opinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policy makers and journalists differ as well.Edwin Feulner, president ofThe Heritage Foundation, said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."[326]However,Mark Weisbrot, co-Director of theCenter for Economic and Policy Research, contended that Reagan's "economic policies were mostly a failure"[327]whileHoward KurtzofThe Washington Postopined that Reagan was "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest."[328]Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president sinceFranklin D. Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication, dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising.[329]Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus,[330]as summarized by British historianM. J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and inAmerican exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.[331]Cold WarThe Cold War was a major political, economic and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of Reagan's presidency.[332]The significance of Reagan's role inending the Cold Warhas spurred contentious and opinionated debate.[333][334][335]That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated,[250]with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.[155][250]United States President Ronald Reagan (left) and President of theSoviet UnionMikhail Gorbachevmeet in 1985.He was first among post&ndash;World War II presidents to put into practice the concept that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with, a post-Détente strategy,[250]a conviction that was vindicated byGennadi Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman under Gorbachev, who said that the Strategic Defense Initiative was "very successful blackmail. ... The Soviet economy couldn't endure such competition."[336]Reagan's aggressive rhetoric toward the USSR had mixed effects; Jeffery W. Knopf observes that being labeled "evil" probably made no difference to the Soviets but gave encouragement to the East-European citizens opposed to communism.[250]General Secretary Gorbachev said of his former rival's Cold War role: "[He was] a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the Cold War",[337]and deemed him "a great president".[337]Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful end; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric.[338]Margaret Thatcher, formerPrime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of Reagan, "he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power... but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform."[339]She later said, "Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired."[340]SaidBrian Mulroney, formerPrime Minister of Canada: "He enters history as a strong and dramatic player [in the Cold War]."[341]FormerPresidentLech Wa??saof Poland acknowledged, "Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse."[342]That Reagan had little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight; that Communism's internal weakness had become apparent, and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power.[250]PresidentHarry Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the U.S.S.R., and theSoviet invasion of Afghanistanundermined the Soviet system itself.[334]Domestic and political legacyReagan inMinneapolis,Minnesota, 1982Ronald Reagan reshaped the Republican party, led the modernconservative movement, and altered the political dynamic of the United States.[343]More men voted Republican under Reagan, and Reagan tapped into religious voters.[343]The so-called "Reagan Democrats" were a result of his presidency.[343]After leaving office, Reagan became an iconic influence within the Republican party.[344]His policies and beliefs have been frequently invoked byRepublican presidential candidatessince 1989.[21]The2008 Republican presidential candidateswere no exception, for they aimed to liken themselves to him during the primary debates, even imitating his campaign strategies.[345]Republican nomineeJohn McCainfrequently said that he came to office as "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution".[346]Reagan's most famous statement regarding the role of smaller government was that "Government is not a solution to our problem, government is the problem."[347]Reagan has become an iconic figure in the Republican Party, with praise for his accomplishments part of the standard GOP rhetoric a quarter century after his retirement.Washington Postreporter Carlos Lozada notes how in the 2016 presidential race the main Republican contenders have adopted "standard GOP Gipper worship," including even Donald Trump, who previously had been skeptical.[348]The period of American history most dominated by Ronald Reagan and his policies concerning taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary and theCold Waris known today as theReagan Era, and emphasizes that the conservative "Reagan Revolution," led by Reagan, had a permanent impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The Clinton presidency (1993&ndash;2001) is often treated as an extension of the Reagan Era, as is the Bush presidency (2001&ndash;2009).[349]HistorianEric Fonernoted that the Obama candidacy in 2008 "aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of Reaganism."[350]Campaigning for the Democratic nomination in 2008,Barack Obama, anAmerican liberal, interpreted how Reagan changed the nation's trajectory:I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way thatRichard Nixondid not and in a way thatBill Clintondid not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. I think they felt like with all the excesses of the 1960s and 1970s and government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think that people... he just tapped into what people were already feeling, which was we want clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.[351]Cultural and political imageAccording to columnist Chuck Raasch, "Reagan transformed the American presidency in ways that only a few have been able to".[352]He redefined the political agenda of the times, advocating lower taxes, aconservative economic philosophy, and a stronger military.[353]His role in the Cold War further enhanced his image as a different kind of leader.[354][355]Reagan's "avuncular style, optimism, and plain-folks demeanor" also helped him turn "government-bashing into an art form".[156]Ronald Reagan'sapproval ratingsDateEventApproval (%)Disapproval (%)March 30, 1981Shot by Hinckley7319January 22, 1983High unemployment4254April 26, 1986Libya bombing7026February 26, 1987Iran-Contra affair4451January 20, 1989End of presidency64n/aCareer average5739July 30, 2001(Retrospective)[356]6427As a sitting president, Reagan did not have the highest approval ratings,[357]but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post&ndash;World War II presidents in a 2007Rasmussen Reportspoll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by United Kingdom newspaperThe Times.[358][359][360]In aSiena Collegesurvey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42.[361][362]While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 AnnualC-SPANSurvey of Presidential Leadersranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.[363]Ronald Reagan'sapproval ratings(Gallup 1981&ndash;89)In 2011, theInstitute for the Study of the Americasreleased the first ever UK academic survey to rate U.S. presidents. This poll of UK specialists in U.S. history and politics placed Reagan as the 8th greatest U.S. president.[364]Reagan's ability to connect with Americans[365]earned him the laudatory moniker "The Great Communicator".[366]Of it, Reagan said, "I won the nickname the great communicator. But I never thought it was my style that made a difference&mdash;it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things."[367]His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.[368][369][370]Reagan also earned the nickname "the Teflon President", in that public perceptions of him were not tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration.[371]According to CongresswomanPatricia Schroeder, who coined the phrase, and reporter Howard Kurtz, the epithet referred to Reagan's ability to "do almost anything wrong[371]and not get blamed for it".[365][372]Public reaction to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party.[373]Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans.[214]This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies.[374]However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from manyJews.[375]He emphasizedfamily valuesin his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced.[376]The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, played an important role in defining the 1980s and his future legacy.[377]President Reagan clowning withMuhammad Aliin the oval office, 1983Reagan was known to joke frequently during his lifetime, displayed humor throughout his presidency,[378]and was famous for hisstorytelling.[379]His numerous jokes andone-linershave been labeled "classic quips" and "legendary".[380]Among the most notable of his jokes was one regarding the Cold War. As a microphone test in preparation for hisweekly radio addressin August 1984, Reagan made the following joke: "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever.We begin bombing in five minutes."[381]Former aideDavid Gergencommented, "It was that humor... that I think endeared people to Reagan."[202]HonorsFurther information:List of honors named for Ronald ReaganReagan received a number of awards in his pre- and post-presidential years. After his election as president, Reagan received a lifetime gold membership in the Screen Actors Guild, was inducted into theNational Speakers AssociationSpeaker Hall of Fame[382]and received theUnited States Military Academy'sSylvanus Thayer Award.[383]In 1989, Reagan was made anHonorary Knight Grand Crossof theOrder of the Bath, one of the highest British orders (this entitled him to the use of the post-nominal letters "GCB" but, as a foreign national, not to be known as "Sir Ronald Reagan"); only two American presidents have received this honor, Reagan and George H.W. Bush.[384]Reagan was also named an honorary Fellow ofKeble College, Oxford. Japan awarded him theGrand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemumin 1989; he was the second American president to receive the order and the first to have it given to him for personal reasons (Dwight D. Eisenhowerreceived it as a commemoration of U.S.-Japanese relations).[385]Former President Ronald Reagan returns to the White House to receive thePresidential Medal of Freedomfrom President George H.W. Bush in 1993On January 18, 1993, Reagan's former Vice-President and sitting President George H. W.
