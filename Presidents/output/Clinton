Bush. Aged 46, he was thethird-youngest presidentand the first from thebaby boomergeneration. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history, and signed into law theNorth American Free Trade Agreement. After failing to passnational health care reform, the Democratic House was ousted when theRepublican Partywon controlof theCongressin 1994 for the first time in 40 years. Two years later, Clinton became the first Democrat sinceFranklin D. Rooseveltto be elected president twice.

She left Clinton in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a smallgrocery store.[3]At a time when the Southern United States wassegregated racially, Clinton's grandparents sold goods oncreditto people of all races.[3]In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and marriedRoger Clinton, Sr., who owned anautomobile dealershipinHot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother andEarl T. Ricks.[3]The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned fifteen[5]that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[3]Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as agamblerand an alcoholic who regularlyabusedhis mother and half-brother,Roger Clinton, Jr., to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.[3][6]In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School,Ramble Elementary School, andHot Springs High School&#160;Ц where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[3]Clinton was in the chorus and played thetenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiographyMy Life:Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never beJohn ColtraneorStan Getz. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never beMichael DeBakey. But I knew I could be great in public service.[3]Clinton's interest in law also began in Hot Springs High, when in his Latin class he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancientRoman SenatorCatilinein a mock trial.[7]After a vigorous defense that made use of his "budding rhetorical and political skills", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck that it "made him realize that someday he would study law."[8]Clinton has named two influential moments in his life that contributed to his decision to become a public figure, both occurring in 1963. One was his visit as aBoys Nationsenator to theWhite Houseto meet PresidentJohn F. Kennedy.[3][6]The other was listening toMartin Luther King, Jr.'s 1963I Have a Dreamspeech, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[9]College and law school yearsGeorgetown UniversityClinton ran for President of theStudent Councilwhile attending the School of Foreign Service atGeorgetown University.With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended theEdmund A. Walsh School of Foreign ServiceatGeorgetown Universityin Washington, D.C., receiving aBachelor of Science in Foreign Service(B.S.) degree in 1968. In 1964 and 1965 he won elections forclass president.[10]From 1964 to 1967 he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas SenatorJ. William Fulbright.[3]While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternityAlpha Phi Omega[11]and was elected toPhi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order ofDeMolay,[12]a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became aFreemason. He is a member ofKappa Kappa Psihonorary band fraternity.[13]Rhodes ScholarUpon graduation, he won aRhodes ScholarshiptoUniversity College, Oxfordwhere he studiedPhilosophy, Politics and Economics, though because he had switched programs and had left early for Yale University, he did not receive a degree there.[6][14][15]He developed an interest inrugby union, playing at Oxford[16]and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas.[citation needed]Vietnam War opposition and draft controversyWhile at Oxford he also participated inVietnam War protestsand organized an October 1969Moratorium to End the War in Vietnamevent.[3]Clinton receivedVietnam Wardraft deferments during 1968 and 1969 while he was in England.[17]Planning to attend law school in the U.S, and aware that he might lose his draft deferment, he tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in theNational GuardorAir Force, and then made arrangements to join theReserve Officers' Training Corps(ROTC) program at theUniversity of Arkansas.[18]He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program he had planned to join that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way "to maintain my political viability within the system."[19]Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would have to be drafted before him, which was unlikely. Clinton's political opponents charge that he used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[20]ColonelEugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued anotarizedstatement during the 1992 presidential campaign:I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fulbright's office that Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, should be admitted to theROTCprogram&#160;Е I believe that he purposely deceived me, using the possibility of joining the ROTC as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification.[21]During the 1992 campaign it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in theNavy Reserve, which would have kept him from going to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[22]Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans during his first presidential campaign.[23]Clinton's 1992 campaign manager,James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[24]Law schoolAfter Oxford, Clinton attendedYale Law Schooland earned aJuris Doctor(J.D.) degree in 1973.[3][6]In theYale Law Libraryin 1971 he met fellow law studentHillary Rodham, who was a year ahead of him.[3][25]They began dating and soon were inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for theGeorge McGovern campaignfor the1972 United States presidential electionin order to move in with her in California.[26]They married on October 11, 1975, and their only child,Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[25]Clinton did eventually move to Texas with Rodham to take a job leadingGeorge McGovern's effort there in 1972. He spent considerable time inDallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-termmayor of Dallas,Ron Kirk, futuregovernor of Texas,Ann Richards, and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker)Steven Spielberg.[citation needed]Early political career, 1976Ц92Further information:Electoral history of Bill ClintonGovernor of Arkansas (1979Ц81, 1983Ц92)Further information:Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1978,Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1980andArkansas gubernatorial election, 1982After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at theUniversity of Arkansas. In 1974 he ran for theHouse of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent RepublicanJohn Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from theWatergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52&#160;percent to 48&#160;percent margin. In 1976 Clinton ran forArkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[27]Clinton was elected.[6]Clinton, as the newly electedGovernor of Arkansas, meeting with PresidentJimmy Carterin 1978Clinton was electedGovernor of Arkansasin 1978, having defeated the Republican candidateLynn Lowe, a farmer fromTexarkana. He became the youngest governor in the country at 32. Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the "Boy Governor".[28][29][30]He worked on educational reform and Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from theMariel boatlift) detained inFort Chaffeein 1980.Monroe SchwarzloseofKingslandinCleveland County, polled 31&#160;percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat in the general election that year byRepublicanchallengerFrank D. White. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.[6]Clinton joined friendBruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[31]In 1982, he was again elected governor and kept the office for ten years; beginning with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system.[32]Forsenior citizens, he removed thesales taxfrom medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[33]He became a leading figure among theNew Democrats, a group ofDemocratswho advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as theDemocratic Leadership Council(DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of PresidentRonald Reagan'slandslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[33][34]Clinton delivered theDemocratic responseto President Reagan's1985 State of the Union Addressand served as Chair of theNational Governors Associationfrom 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[6]In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority. Chaired by Clinton's wifeHillary Rodham Clinton, also an attorney and chair of theLegal Services Corporation, the Arkansas Education Standards Committee transformed Arkansas's education system from the worst in the United States to one of the best. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a speciallegislative sessionЧthe longest in Arkansas history.[32]Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[6][33]He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986),JonesborobusinessmenWoody Freeman(1984), andSheffield Nelsonof Little Rock (1990).[27]The Clintons' personal and business affairs in the 1980s included transactions that became the basis of theWhitewater controversyinvestigation that later dogged his presidential administration.[35]After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[6][36]According to some sources, Clinton was in his early years a death penalty opponent who switched positions.[37][38]During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973).[39]As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one byelectric chairand three bylethal injection. Later, as president, Clinton was the first President to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reintroduced in 1988.[40]1988 Democratic presidential primariesGovernor and Mrs. Clinton attend the Dinner Honoring the Nation's Governors in theWhite Housewith PresidentRonald Reaganand first ladyNancy Reagan, 1987.In 1987, there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then-New York GovernorMario Cuomodeclined to run and Democratic front-runnerGary Hartwithdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored&#160;Ц but ultimately vetoed&#160;Ц by the First Lady).[41]For the nomination, Clinton endorsedMassachusetts GovernorMichael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice as long as it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[42]and poorly delivered.[43]Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, he headed the moderateDemocratic Leadership Councilin 1990 and 1991.[33][44]Presidency (1993Ц2001)Main article:Presidency of Bill ClintonCountries visited by President Clinton during his terms in office.During his presidency,Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, much of which was enacted into law or was implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly theNorth American Free Trade Agreementandwelfare reform, have been attributed to acentristThird Wayphilosophy of governance.[45][46]On budgetary matters his policy offiscal conservatismhelped to reduce deficits.[47][48]Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[49][50][51]TheCongressional Budget Officereported budget surpluses of $69&#160;billion in 1998, $126&#160;billion in 1999, and $236&#160;billion in 2000,[52]during the last three years of Clinton's presidency.[53]The U.S. treasury reported a debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, and a debt of $5.656 trillion in 1999.[54]At the end of his presidency, Clinton moved to New York and helped his wife win election to the U.S. Senate there.1992 presidential campaignFurther information:Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992,United States presidential election, 1992andBill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992In the first primary contest, theIowa caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa SenatorTom Harkin. During the campaign for theNew Hampshire primary, reports of an extramarital affair withGennifer Flowerssurfaced. As Clinton fell far behind formerMassachusettsSenatorPaul Tsongasin the New Hampshire polls,[6]followingSuper Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on60 Minutesto rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in theNew Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him "The Comeback Kid" for earning a firm second-place finish.[55]Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of theSouthern primariesonSuper Tuesdaygave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California GovernorJerry Brownwas scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[6][44]With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[44]Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory inJerry Brown's home state of California.[6]Clinton family in theWhite HouseDuring the campaign, questions ofconflict of interestregarding state business and the politically powerfulRose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[3][56]Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents "for the price of one".[57]While campaigning for U.S. President, the then Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see thatRicky Ray Rectorwould be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to Arkansas state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in aThe New York Timesarticle as a possible political move to counter "soft on crime" accusations.[37][58]Because Bush'sapproval ratingswere around 80&#160;percent during theGulf War, he was described as unbeatable. However, when Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on hispromise not to raise taxes, hurting his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[44]By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40&#160;percent.[44][59]Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. WhenPat BuchananandPat Robertsonaddressed Christian themes at theRepublican National Convention&#160;Ц with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform&#160;Ц many moderates were alienated.[60]Clinton then pointed to his moderate, "New Democrat" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[61]Many Democrats who had supportedRonald Reaganand Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[62]Clinton and his running mate,Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a "new beginning".[62]Clinton won the1992 presidential election(43.0&#160;percent of the vote) against Republican incumbentGeorge H. W. Bush(37.4&#160;percent of the vote) and billionairepopulistRoss Perot, who ran as an independent (18.9&#160;percent of the vote) on a platform focusing on domestic issues; a significant part of Clinton's success was Bush's steep decline in public approval.[62]Clinton's election ended twelve years of Republican rule of theWhite Houseand twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of theUnited States Congress,[4]the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the95th United States Congressduring theJimmy Carterpresidency in the late 1970s.[63][64]First term, 1993Ц97First inauguration of Bill Clinton (January 20, 1993)Play mediaVideo of theFirst inauguration of Bill Clinton.First inauguration of Bill Clinton (January 20, 1993)Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.audio only versionProblems playing these files?

Shortly after taking office, Clinton signed theFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993on February 5, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[65]and proved quite popular with the public.[66]Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993Чthe 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision inRoe v. Wade, Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and internationalfamily planningprograms that had been imposed by Clinton's predecessors, Ronald Regan and George H.W. Bush.[67]Clinton said that abortion should be kept "safe, legal, and rare"Чa slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientistSamuel L. Popkinand first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[68]During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[69]On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to cap thebudget deficit.[70]Two days later, in a nationally televised address to ajoint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[71]Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[72]On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office, causing theWhite House travel office controversyeven though the Travel Office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could bedismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming the firings were done because of financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[73]Critics contended the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[74]"Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."Inaugural address, January 20, 1993.[75]Clinton signed theOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993in August of that year, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90&#160;percent of small businesses,[76]and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2&#160;percent of taxpayers. Additionally, through the implementation of spending restraints, it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years.[77]Clinton,Yitzhak RabinandYasser Arafatduring the Oslo Accords on September 13, 1993.Clinton made a major speech to Congress regardinga health care reform planon September 22, 1993, aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda, and resulted from a task force headed byHillary Clinton. Though at first well received in political circles, it was eventually doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, theAmerican Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However,John F. Harris, a biographer of Clinton's, states the program failed because of a lack of coordination within theWhite House.[36]Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation byGeorge J. Mitchellfailed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton's administration.[33][36]In November 1993,David Hale, the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in theWhitewater controversy, alleged that Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal.[78]AU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioninvestigation did result in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains innocence in the affair.Clinton signed theBrady Billinto law on November 30, 1993, which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. He also expanded theEarned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[36]In December of that year, allegations by Arkansas state troopersLarry Pattersonand Roger Perry were first reported byDavid Brockinthe American Spectator. Later known asTroopergate, the allegations by these men were that they arranged sexual liaisons for Bill Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman namedPaula, a reference toPaula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated "bad journalism" and that "the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives."[79]Remarks on the Signing of NAFTA (December 8, 1993)Play mediaClinton's December 8, 1993 remarks on the signing of theNorth American Free Trade AgreementRemarks on the Signing of NAFTA (December 8, 1993)Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.audio only versionProblems playing these files? Seemedia help.That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", which allowedgay men and womento serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a secret, and forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[80]The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including SenatorsJohn McCain(R-AZ) andSam Nunn(D-GA). According toDavid Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that "the President should lift the ban Е even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress".[81]Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[82]Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that PresidentHarry Trumanused executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argue that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[33]Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not "out of whack".[83]The policy remained controversial, and was finallyrepealed in 2011, removing open sexual preference as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[84]On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed theNorth American Free Trade Agreementinto law.[85]Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters ofRoss Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President.[85]TheOmnibus Crime Billwhich Clinton signed into law in 1994[86]made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, "My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons."[87]"When I took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the Worldwide Web&#160;Е Now even my cat has its own page."Bill Clinton's announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, 1996.[88]The Clinton administration also launched the first officialWhite Housewebsite,whitehouse.gov, on October 21, 1994.[89][90]It was followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[91][92]The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, "Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011&#160;Ц Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public."[93]After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in themid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[94]Clinton andRussian PresidentBoris Yeltsinin October 1995Ken Gormley, Dean of the School of Law at Duquesne University in Pittsburg, authored a book titledThe Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr. In his book, Gormley reveals President Clinton narrowly escaped assassination in the Philippines in 1996. During his visit to theAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation(APEC) forum in Manila, Clinton was saved minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[95]According to officials, the IED was large enough to "blow up the entire presidential motorcade".[96]Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley byLewis Merletti, former member of the Presidential Protection Detail and Director of theSecret Service. The President was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government when disaster was averted. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[95]This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[96]Once more, the word "wedding" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[96]Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting; however, following the advice of the secret service saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[97]Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[98]Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[98]The President was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known asal-Qaedaand the plot was masterminded byOsama bin Laden.[96]Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[96]Bill Clinton made health care reform one of his highest priorities; the First Lady chaired the Task Force on National Health Care Reform.TheWhite House FBI files controversyof June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House toFBIsecurity-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[99]In March 2000, Independent CounselRobert Raydetermined that there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, "there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved" in seeking the files.[100]On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law theDefense of Marriage Act(DOMA), which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states.[101]Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA "was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election." In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to "head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a "very reactionary Congress."[102]Administration spokesmanRichard Socaridessaid, "Е&#160;the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected."[103]Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something "which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for President Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that."[104]Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activistEvan Wolfsonhas called these claims "historic revisionism".[103]In a July 2, 2011 editorialThe New York Timesopined, "The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.".[105]In June 2013, the United States Supreme Court, inUnited States v. Windsor, struck down DOMA.[106]Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first President to select openly gay persons for Administration positions,[107]and is generally credited as the first President to publicly champion gay rights.[108]During his Presidency, Clinton controversially issued two substantial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[109]and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[110]Under President Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[111]And Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sectorEmployment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[112]Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by theHuman Rights Campaign.[108]Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[113]and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[114]He was later honored byGLAADfor his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[115]As part of a 1996 initiative to curbillegal immigration, Clinton signed theIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act(IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[116]theU.S. Commission on Immigration Reformrecommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[117][118]The1996 United States campaign finance controversywas an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself. The Chinese government denied all accusations.[119]1996 presidential electionPresident Bill Clinton (center), first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton (right) and their daughterChelsea(left) wave to watchers at a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, January 20, 1997.In the1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2&#160;percent of the popular vote over RepublicanBob Dole(40.7&#160;percent of the popular vote) andReformcandidateRoss Perot(8.4&#160;percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent sinceLyndon Johnsonto be elected to a second term and the first Democrat sinceFranklin D. Rooseveltto be elected President more than once.[120]The Republicans lost a few seats in the House and gained a few in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70&#160;percent of theElectoral Collegevotes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.Second term, 1997Ц2001Al GoreandNewt Gingrichapplaud as US president Clinton waves during theState of the Union addressin 1997.In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide coverage to up to five million children. SenatorsTed Kennedy&#160;Ц a Democrat&#160;Ц andOrrin Hatch&#160;Ц a Republican&#160;Ц teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming theState Children's Health Insurance Program(SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress theAdoption and Safe Families Actand two years later she succeeded in helping pass theFoster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of theBalanced Budget Act of 1997by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[121]In 1999 Clinton signed into law theFinancial Services Modernization Actalso known as theGramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed the part of theGlassЦSteagall Actthat had prohibited a bank from offering a full range ofinvestment,commercial banking, andinsuranceservices since its enactment in 1933.[122]Impeachment and acquittalClinton's impeachment trial in 1999Main article:Impeachment and acquittal of Bill ClintonAfter the 1998 elections, the Houseimpeached Clinton, allegingperjuryandobstruction of justicerelated to theLewinsky scandal.[36]Clinton was only the second U.S. President to be impeached, afterAndrew Johnson. Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and laterDepartment of Defense) employeeMonica Lewinsky.[123]After theStarr Reportwas submitted to the House providing what it termed "substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment",[124]the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before themid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called alame-duck sessionin December 1998.While theHouse Judiciary Committeehearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were forperjuryandobstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before agrand jurythat had been convened to investigateperjuryhe may have committed in his sworn deposition duringPaula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.[125]The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges.[126]The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firmWilliams &amp; Connolly.[127]The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[126]and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[128]Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[126]Pardons and commutationsClintoncontroversially issued141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[36][129]Most of the controversy surroundedMarc Richand allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother,Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.[130]Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.[131]Military and foreign eventsFurther information:Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administrationPresident Clinton speaks withCol.Paul Fletcher,USAF, before boardingAir Force One, November 4, 1999.Many military events occurred during Clinton's presidency. TheBattle of Mogadishuoccurred inSomaliain 1993. During the operation,two U.S. helicopterswere shot down byrocket-propelled grenadeattacks to theirtail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets&#160;Ц a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. andNATOaircraftattacked Bosnian Serb targetsto halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequentDayton Agreement.General John P.

The president visited several European air bases to thank the troops (not shown) for their support of NATO Operations Allied Force and Shining Hope, 1999.In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to payIranUS$131.8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in theInternational Court of Justiceafter the shooting down ofIran Air Flight 655by the U.S. Navyguided missile cruiser.[132]CapturingOsama bin Ladenhad been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be untilbin Laden's death in 2011).[133]Despite claims byMansoor Ijazand Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden and that that U.S. authorities rejected each offer[134]the9/11 Commission Reportstated that "we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim."[135]In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africabyal-Qaeda(which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, both of which were unsuccessful.[136]In August 1998, Clintonordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting theAl-Shifa pharmaceutical factoryin Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.[137]President Clinton greets Air Force personnel atSpangdahlem Air Base, May 5, 1999.To stop theethnic cleansingandgenocide[138][139]ofAlbaniansby anti-guerilla military units in the formerFederal Republic of Yugoslavia's province ofKosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in aNATObombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, namedOperation Allied Force. GeneralWesley ClarkwasSupreme Allied Commander of NATOand oversaw the mission. WithUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized apeacekeeping forceto be deployed to the region.[140]NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths,[141]and two deaths from anApache helicoptercrash.[142]Opinions in the popular press criticized pre-war genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[143][144]In 2001, theU.N.-supervisedSupreme Court of Kosovoruled that genocide did not take place, but recognized "a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments."[145]The term "ethnic cleansing" was used as an alternative to "genocide" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is no difference.[146]Slobodan MiloЪevi?, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, waseventually brought to trialbefore theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslaviainthe Hagueon charges ofcrimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes.[147]MiloЪevi? died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[147][148]In Clinton's1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictatorSaddam Husseinwas possibly pursuing nuclear weapons:Together we must also confront the new hazards ofchemicalandbiological weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, "You cannot defy the will of the world", and when I say to him, "You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[149]Bill Clinton andJiang Zeminholding a joint press conference at the White House, October 29, 1997Seeking to weaken Saddam Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed theIraq Liberation Act of 1998into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of "regime change" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[150][151]The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign namedOperation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that "So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors."[152]American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[153][154]Clinton's November 2000 visit toVietnamwas the first by a U.S. president since the end of theVietnam War.[155]On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law theU.S.ЦChina Relations Act of 2000, which grantedpermanent normal trade relations(PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China.[156]The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[157]Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federalbudget surplusfor the first time since 1969.[158]After initial successes such as theOslo Accordsof the early 1990s, Clinton attempted to address theArabЦIsraeli conflict. Clinton brought Israeli Prime MinisterEhud Barakand Palestinian Authority ChairmanYasser Arafattogether atCamp Davidfor the2000 Camp David Summit.[36]Following the peace talk failures, Clinton stated Arafat "missed the opportunity" to facilitate a "just and lasting peace." In hisautobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[3][159]The situation broke down completely with the start of theSecond Intifada.[36]Judicial appointmentsRuth Bader Ginsburgaccepting her nomination to the Supreme Court from President Clinton.Main articles:Bill Clinton Supreme Court candidatesandBill Clinton judicial appointmentsClinton appointed two justices to theSupreme Court:Ruth Bader Ginsburgin 1993[160]andStephen Breyerin 1994.[161]Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to theUnited States courts of appealsand 305 judges to theUnited States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number ofjudicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees tofederal judgeshipsdid not receive a vote in theRepublican-controlledSenate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84&#160;percent of his nominees were confirmed.[162]Among the judges appointed by Clinton to the courts of appeals wasSonia Sotomayor, who was nominated by Clinton in 1997 to theSecond Circuitand confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year caused by Republican opposition.[163][164]Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[165]In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[166]Clinton appointed the first African American judges to theFourth Circuit(Roger L. Gregory) and theSeventh Circuit(Ann C. Williams).[166]Clinton also appointed the nation's first openlygay or lesbianfederal judge when he namedDeborah A. Battsto theU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in avoice votein 1994.[167]Public opinionClinton'sapproval ratingsthroughout his presidential careerClinton's job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s throughout his first term. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[168]After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[169]According to aCBS News/New York Timespoll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68&#160;percent, which matched those ofRonald ReaganandFranklin D. Rooseveltas the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[170]Clinton's averageGallup pollapproval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[171]Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[171]As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45&#160;percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55&#160;percent thought he "would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life"; 68&#160;percent thought he would be remembered more for his "involvement in personal scandal" than for "his accomplishments"; and 58&#160;percent answered "No" to the question "Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?"[171]The same percentage said he would be remembered as either "outstanding" or "above average" as a president, while 22&#160;percent said he would be remembered as "below average" or "poor."[171]ABC Newscharacterized public consensus on Clinton as, "You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics&#160;Ц  and he's done a heck of a good job."[172]In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[173]Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13% of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[174][175]In 2014, 18% of respondents in aQuinnipiac University Polling Institutepoll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behindJohn F. KennedyandRonald Reagan.[176]The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[176]A 2015 poll byThe Washington Postasked 162 scholars of theAmerican Political Science Associationto rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[177]Public imageMain article:Public image of Bill ClintonClinton greets aHurricane Katrinaevacuee, September 5, 2005.

In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by JudgeSusan Webber Wrightas lacking legal merit.[194]But Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[195]In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents contending a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas.Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing "a pack of lies" and "an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[196]Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement, paying $850,000.[197]Bennett said that the President only made the settlement so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[198]During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[199]Clintondenied having sexual relationswithMonica Lewinsky&#160;Ц  a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[200]In 1992,Gennifer Flowersstated that she had a relationship with Clinton that began in 1980.[201]Flowers at first denied that she had an affair with Clinton, but later changed her story.[202][203]After Clinton at first denied having a relationship with Flowers on60 Minutes, he later admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.[204]In 1998,Kathleen Willeyalleged that Clinton groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave "false information" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[205]On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released anaffidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by President Clinton in the Oval Office.[206]An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[207]Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[208]Also in 1998,Juanita Broaddrickalleged Clinton had raped her though she did not remember the exact date, which may have been 1978.[209]In another 1998 event,Elizabeth Ward Gracenrecanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982.[210]Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton.[211]Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded asubpoenafrom Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court.[212]Post-presidency (2001Цpresent)Main article:Post-presidency of Bill ClintonClinton at a Democratic "Get out the vote" rally in Los Angeles on November 2, 2000Bill Clinton continues to be active in public life, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations.[213]Clinton has spoken inprime timeat everyDemocratic National Conventionsince 1988.[214]Activities up until 2008 campaignIn 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[215][216]and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[217]In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at theUnited Nations Climate Change Conferencein Montreal.[218]TheWilliam J.

Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10&#160;million toward her campaign.[234]Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[235]Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[236]Considering Bill's remarks, many thought that he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[237]Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the2008 Democratic National Convention, saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is "ready to lead."[238]After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[239][240]After the 2008 electionClinton with President Barack Obama and Senior AdvisorValerie Jarrettin July 2010In 2009, Clinton travelled toNorth Koreaon behalf oftwo American journalists imprisoned in North Korea.Euna LeeandLaura Linghad been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[241]Jimmy Carterhad made a similar visit in 1994.[241]After Clinton met with North Korean leaderKim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[242][243]Since then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United NationsSpecial EnvoytoHaitiin 2009.[244]In response to the2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton andGeorge W. Bushwould coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery.[245]Clinton continues to visit Haiti to witness the inauguration of refugee villages, and to raise funds for victims of the earthquake.[246]In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration ofNTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation.[247][248]At the2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[249]Post-presidential health concernsIn September 2004, Clinton received a quadruple bypass surgery.[250]In March 2005, he underwent surgery for a partially collapsed lung.[251]On February 11, 2010, he was rushed toColumbia Presbyterian Hospitalin New York City after complaining of chest pains, and had twocoronary stentsimplanted in his heart.[250][252]After this experience, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet recommended by doctorsDean OrnishandCaldwell Esselstyn.[253]Clinton has reportedly begun practicingBuddhist meditationin order to help him relax.[254]Income and personal financesThe Clintons accrued several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency; they were paid off four years after he left office.[255]Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have received millions of dollars in book authorship fees.[256]In May 2015,The Hillreported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book,Hard Choices,during the same time period.[257]In July 2014, theDaily Mailreported that together, the couple "has earned more than $160 million in the decade after Bill's second presidential term came to an end."[258]Also in July 2014, theWall Street Journalreported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[259]Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[260]In June 2014,ABC NewsandThe Washington Postreported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, theNew York Timesreported that the Clintons' income tax returns[261]show they have made $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.[256][262][263][264]Hillary Clinton said that she and Bill came out of the White House financially "broke" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. "We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education." She added, "Bill has worked really hardЕwe had to pay off all our debtsЕhe had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members."[263]Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe, often earning $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[265]According to his wife's Senate ethics reports, he earned more than $30 million in speaking from 2001 to 2005.[266]In 2007, it is estimated he amassed around $40 million from speaking.[267]Honors and recognitionMain article:List of honors and awards earned by Bill ClintonSecretary of DefenseCohenpresents President Clinton the DoD Medal for Distinguished Public Service.Bill Clinton statue inPristina, the capital of theRepublic of KosovoVarious colleges and universities have awarded Clintonhonorary degrees, includingDoctorate of Lawdegrees[268][269]andDoctor of Humane Lettersdegrees.[270]He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as aRhodes Scholar.[271]Schools have been named for Clinton,[272][273][274]and statues have been built to pay him homage.[275][276][277]U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[278]Arkansas,[279]Kentucky,[280]and New York.[281]He was presented with theMedal for Distinguished Public ServicebySecretary of DefenseWilliam S.
