This was a historic moment, being the first time that a president mentionedgay rightsor the word "gay" in an inaugural address.[164][165]In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs urging theSupreme Courtto rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases ofHollingsworth v. Perry(regardingsame-sex marriage)[166]andUnited States v. Windsor(regarding theDefense of Marriage Act).[167]Then, following theSupreme's Courts decision about same-sex marriagein June 2015, Obama asserted that "This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free."[168]White House advisory and oversight groupsOn March 11, 2009, Obama created theWhite House Council on Women and Girls, which forms part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established byExecutive Order13506with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.[169]The Council is currently chaired bySenior Advisor to the PresidentValerie Jarrett.[170]Obama also established theWhite House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assaultthrough an official United States government memorandum on January 22, 2014 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.[170][171][172]The current co-chairs of the Task Force are Vice PresidentJoe Bidenand Jarrett.[171]The Task Force has been a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls andOffice of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that, the 1994Violence Against Women Actthat was first-drafted by Biden.[173]Economic policyMain article:Economic policy of Barack ObamaPlay mediaObama presents his firstweekly addressas President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009On February 17, 2009, Obama signed theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787&#160;billioneconomic stimuluspackage aimed at helping the economy recover from thedeepening worldwide recession.[174]The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks andincentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[175]In March, Obama's Treasury Secretary,Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage thefinancial crisis, including introducing thePublic-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two&#160;trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.[176]Obama intervened in thetroubled automotive industry[177]in March 2009, renewing loans forGeneral MotorsandChryslerto continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including thesale of Chryslerto Italian automakerFiat[178]and areorganization of GMgiving the U.S. government a temporary 60&#160;percent equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12&#160;percent stake.[179]In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[180]He signed into law theCar Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as "Cash for Clunkers", that temporarily boosted the economy.[181][182][183]DeficitandDebtincreases 2001&ndash;2013Spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5&#160;trillion, but only $3&#160;trillion was spent by the end of November 2009.[184]Obama and theCongressional Budget Officepredicted the 2010budget deficitwould be $1.5&#160;trillion or 10.6&#160;percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4&#160;trillion or 9.9&#160;percent of GDP.[185][186]For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will slightly shrink to $1.34&#160;trillion, while the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53&#160;trillion or 90&#160;percent of GDP.[187]The most recent increase in the U.S.debt ceilingto $17.2&#160;trillion took effect in February 2014.[188]On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisanBudget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5&#160;trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2&#160;trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[189]By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent aU.S. governmentdefaulton its obligations.[190]Employment statistics (changes inunemployment rateand net jobs per month) during Obama's tenure as U.S. President[191][192]As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0&#160;percent and averaging 10.0&#160;percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7&#160;percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6&#160;percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[193]Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8&#160;percent, which was less than the average of 1.9&#160;percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[194]By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7&#160;percent,[195]decreasing to 6.7&#160;percent in the last month of 2013.[196]During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3&#160;percent in the first quarter.[197]GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6&#160;percent, followed by a 5.0&#160;percent increase in the fourth quarter.[198]Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7&#160;percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[198]In July 2010, theFederal Reservenoted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairmanBen Bernankesaid the economic outlook was "unusually uncertain".[199]Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9&#160;percent in 2010.[200]The Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[201][202]The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1&ndash;2.1&#160;million,[202][203][204][205]while conceding that "It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package."[201]Although an April 2010 survey of members of theNational Association for Business Economicsshowed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73&#160;percent of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[206]The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end ofWorld War II.[207]The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States and the austerity measures in the European Union.[208]Within a month of the2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-yearpayroll taxreduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount forestate taxes.[209]The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858&#160;billionTax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[210]In December 2013, Obama declared that growingincome inequalityis a "defining challenge of our time" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of thenationwide strikes of fast-food workersandPope Francis' criticism of inequality andtrickle-down economics.[211]Environmental policySee also:Climate change policy of the United StatesObama at a 2010 briefing on theBP Oil Spillat theCoast GuardStation Venice inVenice, LouisianaOn April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshoredrilling rigat theMacondo Prospectin theGulf of Mexico, causing amajor sustained oil leak. The well's operator,BP, initiated a containment and cleanup plan, and began drilling tworelief wellsintended to stop the flow. Obama visited the Gulf on May 2 among visits by members of his cabinet, and again on May 28 and June 4. On May 22, he announced a federal investigation and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review bySecretary of the InteriorKen Salazarand concurrent Congressional hearings. On May 27, he announced a six-month moratorium on newdeepwater drillingpermits and leases, pending regulatory review.[212]As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[213]In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and stated he "would reject theKeystone XL pipelineif it increased carbon pollution" or "greenhouse emissions".[214][215]Obama's advisers called for a halt topetroleum exploration in the Arcticin January 2013.[216]On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would authorize the pipeline.[217]It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.[218]Health care reformMain article:Health care reform in the United StatesObama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010Obama called forCongressto pass legislation reforminghealth care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[219]He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900&#160;billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as thepublic option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage forpre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[220][221]On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[219]After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivereda speech to a joint session of Congresson September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[222]In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[223]Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income andfederal poverty level, underPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source:CRS)[224]On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[225][226]On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill&mdash;without a public option&mdash;on a party-line vote of 60&ndash;39.[227]On March 21, 2010, thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act(ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.[228]Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[229]The ACA includeshealth-related provisionsto take effect over four years, including expandingMedicaideligibility for people making up to 133&#160;percent of thefederal poverty level(FPL) starting in 2014,[230]subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400&#160;percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 to 9.5&#160;percent of income,[231][232]providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishinghealth insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and Congressional Budget Office figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[231][233]The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-incomebrackets, taxes onindoor tanning, cuts to theMedicare Advantageprogram in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[234]there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[235]In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143&#160;billion over the first decade.[236]The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5&ndash;4 vote inNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebeliusthat the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.[237]InBurwell v. Hobby Lobbythe Court ruled that "closely-held" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under theReligious Freedom Restoration Actfrom regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6&ndash;3 inKing v. Burwellthat subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans "established by the State," as the statute reads.[238]Energy policyMain article:Energy policy of the Obama administrationPrior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly based "All of the above" approach to domestic energy policy which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.[239]Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of nation's available energy resources.[240][241]Gun controlPresident Obama atUniversity of Colorado Hospitalvisiting2012 Aurora shootingvictimsOn January 16, 2013, one month after theSandy Hook Elementary School shooting, President Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[242]He urged Congress to reintroduce anexpired banon military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federalBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosivesfor the first time since 2006.[243]2010 midterm electionsMain articles:United States House of Representatives elections, 2010andUnited States Senate elections, 2010Obama called theNovember 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,[244]"humbling" and a "shellacking".[245]He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.[246]Cybersecurity and Internet policyOn November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended theFederal Communications Commissionreclassifybroadband Internet serviceas atelecommunicationsservice in order to preservenet neutrality.[247][248]On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed Executive Order 13636, "Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity". The Executive Order is designed to increase the level of core capabilities for our critical infrastructure to manage cyber risk. It does this by focusing on three key areas: (1) information sharing, (2) privacy, and (3) the adoption of cybersecurity practices.[249]Foreign policyMain article:Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administrationObama speaking on "A New Beginning" atCairo Universityon June 4, 2009NAFTAleaders Canadian Prime MinisterStephen Harper, Mexican PresidentPeńa Nieto, and U.S. President Barack Obama, 2014In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden andSecretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a "new era" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms "break" and "reset" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[250]Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab cable TV network,Al Arabiya.[251]On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.[252][253]In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara,Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.[254]On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech atCairo Universityin Egypt calling for "A New Beginning" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[255]On June 26, 2009, in response to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters followingIran's 2009 presidential election, Obama said: "The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it."[256]On July 7, while in Moscow, he responded to a Vice President Biden comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: "We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East."[257]On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president topresideover a meeting of theUnited Nations Security Council.[258]In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuto continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods ofEast Jerusalem.[259][260]During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of RussianPresidentDmitry Medvedevto replace the1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treatywith a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about one-third.[261]Obama and Medvedev signed theNew STARTtreaty in April 2010, and theU.S. Senateratified it in December 2010.[262]In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to considerLGBT rightswhen issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[263]He criticized Russia's law discriminating against gays in August 2013,[264]stopping short of advocating a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia.[265]In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended tonormalize relationshipsbetweenCuba and the United States.[266]The countries' respective "interests sections" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.War in IraqMain articles:Iraq WarandAmerican-led intervention in Iraq (2014&ndash;present)On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group ofMarinespreparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, "Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end."[267]The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations tocounter-terrorismand the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[268][269]On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[270]On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be "home for the holidays".[271]In June 2014, following thecapture of Mosulby theIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant(ISIL), Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIL continued to gain ground and to commitwidespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.[272][273]In August 2014, during theSinjar massacre, Obama ordered acampaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIL.[274]By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[275]and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[276]In the Spring of 2015 with the addition of the "Panther Brigade" of the82nd Airborne Divisionthe number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400[277]and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[278]Meeting with British Prime MinisterDavid Cameronduring the2010 G-20 Toronto summitWar in AfghanistanMain article:War in Afghanistan (2001&ndash;present)Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.[279]He announced an increase to U.S. troop levels of 17,000 in February 2009 to "stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan", an area he said had not received the "strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires".[280]He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, GeneralDavid D. McKiernan, with formerSpecial Forcescommander Lt. Gen.Stanley A. McChrystalin May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[281]On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[282]this took place in July 2011.David Petraeusreplaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[283]In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[284]In October 2015, in light of the deteriorating security situation, the White House announced a plan to keep US Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely.[285]IsraelObama meeting with Israeli PresidentShimon Peres, 2009In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemningIsraeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[286]Obama supports thetwo-state solutionto theArab&ndash;Israeli conflictbased on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[287]In June 2012, Obama said that the bond between the United States and Israel is "unbreakable."[288]During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of theU.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Groupand the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[289]The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding theIron Domeprogram in response to the waves ofPalestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[290]In 2013,Jeffrey Goldbergreported that, in Obama's view, "with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation."[291]In 2014, President Obama likened theZionist movementto theCivil Rights Movement in the United States. He said that both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, "To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I&rsquo;ve been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics."[292]War in LibyaMain article:2011 military intervention in LibyaIn March 2011, as forces loyal toMuammar Gaddafiadvanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, theArab League, and a resolution[293]passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[294]In response to the unanimous passage ofUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1973on March 17, Gaddafi&mdash;who had previously vowed to "show no mercy" to the rebels of Benghazi[295]&mdash;announced an immediate cessation of military activities,[296]yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata.

He suggested an intensifieddemocratizationand free trade, to significantly increase living quality for Africans.[323][324]During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever tovisitKenya, which is the homeland of his father.[325]Cultural and political imageMain article:Public image of Barack ObamaSee also:International media reaction to the United States presidential election, 2008andInternational reactions to the United States presidential election, 2012Obama's first term presidential portrait (2009)Obama's family history, upbringing, andIvy Leagueeducation differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in thecivil rights movement.[326]Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is "black enough", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of theNational Association of Black Journaliststhat "we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."[327]Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: "I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation."[328]Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[329]During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama has delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[330]Obama conducting the first completely virtual interview from the White House in 2012[331]According tothe Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68&#160;percent approval rating[332]before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41&#160;percent in August 2010,[333]a trend similar toRonald Reagan's andBill Clinton's first years in office.[334]He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after theDeath of Osama bin Ladenon May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.[335][336]His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52&#160;percent shortly after his second inauguration.[337]Despite him dropping to 39&#160;percent in his approval ratings in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, he has climbed to 50&#160;percent in late January 2015 according tothe Gallup Organization.[338]Polls show strong support for Obama in other countries,[339]and before being elected President he met with prominent foreign figures including former British Prime MinisterTony Blair,[340]Italy'sDemocratic Partyleader and Mayor of RomeWalter Veltroni,[341]andFrench PresidentNicolas Sarkozy.[342]In a February 2009 poll conducted inWestern Europeand the U.S. byHarris InteractiveforFrance 24and theInternational Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[343]In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[344][345]G8 leaders watching the2012 UEFA Champions League FinalObama wonBest Spoken Word AlbumGrammy Awardsfor abridgedaudiobookversions ofDreams from My Fatherin February 2006 and forThe Audacity of Hopein February 2008.[346]Hisconcession speechafter the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video "Yes We Can", which was viewed 10&#160;million times on YouTube in its first month[347]and received aDaytime Emmy Award.[348]In December 2008 and in 2012,Timemagazine named Obama as itsPerson of the Year.[349]The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which Time described as "the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments".[350]On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of theUK ParliamentinWestminster Hall, London. This was only the 5th occurrence since the start of the 20th century, of a head of state being extended this invitation, followingCharles de Gaullein 1960,Nelson Mandelain 1996,Queen Elizabeth IIin 2002 andPope Benedict XVIin 2010.[351][352]On October 9, 2009, theNorwegian Nobel Committeeannounced that Obama had won the2009 Nobel Peace Prize"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples".[353]Obama accepted this award inOslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with "deep gratitude and great humility."[354]The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[355][356][357][358][359][360][361]Obama's peace prize was called a "stunning surprise" byThe New York Times.[362]Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[363]Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute,Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize was a "failure".[364]Family and personal lifeMain article:Family of Barack ObamaObama posing in theGreen Roomof the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia in 2009In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity ofhis extended family: "It's like a little mini-United Nations", he said. "I've got relatives who look likeBernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look likeMargaret Thatcher."[365]Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng, the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband) and seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family&mdash;six of them living.[366]Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[367]until her death on November 2, 2008,[368]two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins inMoneygallin May 2011.[369]InDreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives ofJefferson Davis,President of the Confederate States of Americaduring theAmerican Civil War.[370]Besides his native English, Obamaspeakssome basicIndonesian, having learned the language during his four childhood years in Jakarta.[371][372]He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team;[373]he is left-handed.[374]Obama taking a shot during a game on the White House basketball court, 2009Obama is a supporter of theChicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the2005 ALCSwhen he was still a senator.[375]In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at theAll-Star Gamewhile wearing a White Sox jacket.[376]He is also primarily aChicago Bearsfootball fan in theNFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was afan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory inSuper Bowl XLIII12 days after he took office as President.[377]In 2011, Obama invited the1985 Chicago Bearsto the White House; the team had not visited the White House after theirSuper Bowl winin 1986 due to theSpace Shuttle Challenger disaster.[378]In June 1989, Obama metMichelle Robinsonwhen he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm ofSidley Austin.[379]Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date.[380]They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[381]The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998,[382]followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), on June 10, 2001.[383]The Obama daughters attended the privateUniversity of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the privateSidwell Friends School.[384]The Obamas have twoPortuguese Water Dogs, the first, a male namedBo, a gift from SenatorTed Kennedy.[385]In August 2013, Bo was joined bySunny, a female.[386]Applying the proceeds of a book deal, the family moved in 2005 from aHyde Park, Chicagocondominium to a $1.6&#160;million house in neighboringKenwood, Chicago.[387]The purchase of an adjacent lot&mdash;and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friendTony Rezko&mdash;attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[388]In December 2007,Moneyestimated the Obama family's net worth at $1.3&#160;million.[389]Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5&#160;million&mdash;up from about $4.2&#160;million in 2007 and $1.6&#160;million in 2005&mdash;mostly from sales of his books.[390][391]On his 2010 income of $1.7&#160;million, he gave 14&#160;percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 toFisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[392][393]As per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10&#160;million.[394]Obama tried to quit smoking several times, sometimes usingnicotine replacement therapy, and, in early 2010, Michelle Obama said that he had successfully quit smoking.[395][396]Religious viewsSee also:Barack Obama religion conspiracy theoriesObama and First Lady worship atAfrican Methodist Episcopal Churchin Washington, D.C., January 2013Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[397]He wrote inThe Audacity of Hopethat he "was not raised in a religious household". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as "non-practicingMethodistsandBaptists"), as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known." He described his father as a "confirmedatheist" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working withblack churchesas acommunity organizerwhile in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."[398]In January 2008, Obama toldChristianity Today: "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death andresurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life."[399]On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't&mdash;frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead&mdash;being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me."[400][401]Obama metTrinity United Church of Christpastor Rev.Jeremiah Wrightin October 1987, and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[402]He resigned from Trinity in May 2008 during his first presidential campaign aftersome of Wright's statements were criticized.[403]The Obama family has attended several Protestant churches since moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, includingShiloh Baptist ChurchandSt. John's Episcopal Church. After a prolonged effort to find a church to attend regularly in Washington, Obama announced in June 2009 that his primary place of worship would be the Evergreen Chapel atCamp David.[404]Notes and referencesNotes^"Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Lifeť Blog Archive &#160;ť Barack Obama".pewforum.org.
