TheNuclear Test Ban Treaty, the establishment of thePeace Corps, developments in theSpace Race, the building of theBerlin Wall, theCivil Rights Movement, and increased U.S. involvement in theVietnam Warall took place during his presidency.Kennedy's time in office is also marked by high tensions with communist states, and Cuba in particular. Anattemptin April 1961 to overthrow the country's dictator,Fidel Castro, was thwarted by armed forces within three days. His administration subsequently rejected plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff toorchestrate false-flag attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba. In October 1962, it was discovered Sovietballistic missileshad been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of unease, often termed theCuban Missile Crisis, is seen by many historians as the closest the human race has ever come tonuclear war.After military service ascommanderofPT boatsPT-109andPT-59during World War II in theSouth Pacific, Kennedy representedMassachusetts's 11th congressional districtin theU.S. House of Representativesfrom 1947 to 1953 as aDemocrat. Thereafter, he served in theU.S. Senatefrom that state from 1953 until 1960. Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidateRichard Nixonin the1960 U.S. Presidential Election. At age 43, he was the youngest man to have been elected to the office,[2][a]the second-youngest president (afterTheodore Roosevelt, who was 42 when he became president after the assassination ofWilliam McKinley). Kennedy was the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president.[3]To date[update], Kennedy has been the onlyRoman Catholicpresident and the only president to have won aPulitzer Prize.[4]Kennedy wasassassinatedinDallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.Lee Harvey Oswaldwas arrested that afternoon and charged with the crime that night.Jack Rubyshot and killed Oswald two days later, before Oswald could be prosecuted. TheFBIand theWarren Commissionofficially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin. TheUnited States House Select Committee on Assassinations(HSCA) agreed with the conclusion that Oswald fired the shots that killed the president, but also concluded that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of aconspiracy.[5]Since the 1960s, information concerning Kennedy's private life has come to light. Details of Kennedy's health problems with which he struggled have become better known, especially since the 1990s. Although initially kept secret from the general public, reports of Kennedy being unfaithful in marriage have garnered much press. Kennedy ranks highly inhistorians' polls of U.S. presidents, although a slight gap exists between his public reputation and his standing among academics,[6]with the public generally more commendatory.Contents1Early life and education2Military service (1941&ndash;45)3Congressional career3.1U.S. House of Representatives (1947&ndash;1953)3.2U.S. Senate (1953&ndash;1960)41960 presidential election5Presidency (1961&ndash;1963)5.1Foreign policy5.1.1Cuba and the Bay of Pigs Invasion5.1.2Cuban Missile Crisis5.1.3Latin America and communism5.1.4Peace Corps5.1.5Southeast Asia5.1.6American University speech5.1.7West Berlin speech5.1.8Israel5.1.9Iraq5.1.10Ireland5.1.11Nuclear Test Ban Treaty5.2Domestic policy5.2.1Economy5.2.2Federal and military death penalty5.2.3Civil rights5.2.4Civil liberties5.2.5Immigration5.2.6Native American relations5.3Space policy6Assassination6.1Funeral7Administration, Cabinet, and judicial appointments 1961&ndash;637.1Judicial appointments7.1.1Supreme Court7.1.2Other courts8Image, social life, and family8.1Children8.2Popular image8.3"Camelot Era"8.4Health8.5Personal tragedies8.6Extramarital relationships9Ancestry10Legacy10.1Eponyms10.2Memorials11Coat of arms12Media13See also14Notes15References16Bibliography17Further reading17.1Primary sources17.2Historiography and memory18External linksEarly life and educationJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy was born at83 Beals StreetinBrookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917,[7]to businessman/politicianJoseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy, Sr.(1888&ndash;1969) and philanthropist/socialiteRose Elizabeth Fitzgerald-Kennedy(1890&ndash;1995). His father was the oldest son of businessman/politicianPatrick Joseph "P. J." Kennedy(1858&ndash;1929) and Mary Augusta Hickey-Kennedy (1857&ndash;1923). His mother was the daughter of Boston MayorJohn Francis "Honey Fitz" Fitzgerald(1863&ndash;1950) and Mary Josephine "Josie" Hannon-Fitzgerald (1865&ndash;1964). All four of his grandparents were the children of immigrants fromIreland.[1]His brothers wereJoseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy, Jr.(1915&ndash;1944),Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy(1925&ndash;1968), andEdward Moore "Ted" Kennedy(1932&ndash;2009). Joseph Jr. waskilled in actionduring World War II. Robert was JFK's attorney general and then a senator; Ted was a long serving senator from 1962 until his death in 2009. His sisters wereRose Marie "Rosemary" Kennedy(1918&ndash;2005),Kathleen Agnes "Kick" Kennedy(1920&ndash;1948),Eunice Mary Kennedy(1921&ndash;2009), Patricia Helen "Pat" Kennedy (1924&ndash;2006), andJean Ann Kennedy(born 1928).Kennedy lived in Brookline for 10 years and attended theEdward Devotion School, theNoble and Greenough Lower School, and theDexter Schoolthrough 4th grade. In 1927, the Kennedy family moved to a stately twenty-room Georgian-style mansion at 5040 Independence Avenue (across the street fromWave Hill) in theHudson Hillneighborhood ofRiverdale, Bronx, New York City. Kennedy attended theRiverdale Country School, a private school for boys, from 5th to 7th grade. Two years later, the family moved to 294 Pondfield Road in the New York City suburb ofBronxville, New York, where Kennedy was a member of Scout Troop 2.[1]The Kennedy family spent summers attheir homeinHyannisport, Massachusettsand Christmas and Easter holidays at their winter home inPalm Beach, Florida. In September 1930, Kennedy&mdash;now 13 years old&mdash;attended theCanterbury SchoolinNew Milford, Connecticut. In late April 1931, he required anappendectomy, after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.[8]The Kennedy family atHyannisportin 1931 with Jack at top left in white shirt. Ted was born the following year.In September 1931, Kennedy was sent to theThe Choate SchoolinWallingford, Connecticutfor 9th through 12th grade. His older brother had already been at Choate for two years as a football player and leading student. He spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow, and compensated for this with rebellious behavior which attracted a coterie. Their most notorious stunt was to explode a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the ensuing chapel assembly, the strict headmaster George St. John brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain "muckers" who would "spit in our sea". The defiant Kennedy took the cue and named his groupThe Muckers Club, which included roommate and friendKirk LeMoyne "Lem" Billings.[9]During his Choate years, Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated in 1934 with his emergency hospitalization atYale&#160;&ndash; New Haven Hospitalwhere doctors thought he might have leukemia.[10]In June 1934, he was admitted to theMayo ClinicinRochester, Minnesota, the ultimate diagnosis there wascolitis.[10]Kennedy graduated from Choate in June of the following year. For the school yearbook, of which he had been business manager, Kennedy was voted the "most likely to succeed".[9]In September 1935, he made his first trip abroad with his parents and his sister Kathleen to London with the intent of studying underHarold Laskiat theLondon School of Economics(LSE) as his older brother had done. Ill-health forced his return to America in October of that year, when he enrolled late and spent six weeks atPrinceton University. He was then hospitalized for observation atPeter Bent Brigham Hospitalin Boston. He convalesced further at the Kennedy winter home in Palm Beach, then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand on the 40,000 acres (160&#160;km2) "Jay Six" cattle ranch outsideBenson, Arizona.[11]It is reported that ranchmanJack Speidenworked both brothers "very hard".In September 1936, Kennedy enrolled atHarvard College, where he produced that year's annual "Freshman Smoker", called by a reviewer "an elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio, screen and sports world".[12]He tried out for the football, golf, and swimming teams and earned a spot on the varsity swimming team.[13]Kennedy also sailed in theStar classand won the 1936 Nantucket Sound Star Championship.[14]In July 1937, Kennedy sailed to France&mdash;bringing his convertible&mdash;and spent ten weeks driving through Europe with Billings.[15]In June 1938, Kennedy sailed overseas with his father and older brother to work at theAmerican embassy in Londonwhere his father was PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt's U.S. Ambassador to theCourt of St. James's.[16]In 1939, Kennedy toured Europe, theSoviet Union, theBalkans, and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis. He then went toCzechoslovakiaand Germany before returning to London on September 1, 1939; that was the dayGermany invaded Poland. Two days later, the family was in theHouse of Commonsfor speeches endorsing the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany. Kennedy was sent as his father's representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of theSSAtheniabefore flying back to the U.S. fromFoynes, IrelandtoPort Washington, New Yorkon his first transatlantic flight.As an upperclassman at Harvard, Kennedy became a more serious student and developed an interest in political philosophy. In his junior year, he made theDean's List.[17]In 1940, Kennedy completed his thesis, "Appeasement in Munich", about British participation in theMunich Agreement. The thesis became a bestseller under the titleWhy England Slept.[18]He graduated from Harvard College with aBachelor of Sciencecum laudeininternational affairsthat year. Kennedy enrolled in and audited classes at theStanford Graduate School of Businessthat fall.[19]In early 1941, he helped his father write a memoir of his three years as an American ambassador and then traveled throughout South America.[20]On September 12, 1953, Kennedy marriedJacqueline Bouvierat St. Mary's Church inNewport, Rhode Islandafter a one-year courtship.[21]Military service (1941&ndash;45)Main article:Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109Lieutenant (junior grade)John F. Kennedy (standing at right) with hisPT-109crew, 1943.In September 1941, after medical disqualification by the Army for his chronic lower back problems, Kennedy joined theU.S. Navy, with the influence of the director of theOffice of Naval Intelligence, former navalattachéto Joseph Kennedy.[22]Kennedy was anensignserving in the office of theSecretary of the Navywhen theattack on Pearl Harboroccurred. He attended theNaval Reserve Officer Training Corpsand then voluntarily entered the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island.[23]His first command wasPT-101, from December 7, 1942 until February 23, 1943. It was a PT boat used for training while Kennedy was an instructor at Melville.[24]He then led threeHuckins PT boats&mdash;PT-98,PT-99, andPT-101, which were being relocated from MTBRON 4 in Melville, Rhode Island, back to Jacksonville, Florida and the new MTBRON 14 (formed February 17, 1943). During the transit South, he was briefly hospitalized in Jacksonville after diving in the cold water to unfoul a propeller. Thereafter, he was assigned duty inPanamaand later in thePacific theater, where Kennedy earned the rank of lieutenant, eventually commanding two morepatrol torpedo (PT) boats.[25]Kennedy on his navy patrol boat, thePT-109.On August 2, 1943, Kennedy's boat, thePT-109, along with thePT-162and thePT-169, was performing nighttime patrols nearNew Georgiain theSolomon Islands,[26]whenPT-109was rammed by theJapanese destroyerAmagiri.[27]Kennedy gathered his surviving crew members together in the water around the wreckage, to vote on whether to "fight or surrender". Kennedy stated, "There's nothing in the book about a situation like this. A lot of you men have families and some of you have children. What do you want to do? I have nothing to lose." Shunning surrender, the men swam towards a small island.[28]Kennedy, despite re-injury to his back in the collision, towed a badly burned crewman through the water with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.[29]He towed the wounded man to the island, and later to a second island, from where his crew was subsequently rescued.[30]For these actions, Kennedy received theNavy and Marine Corps Medalwith the following citation:For extremely heroic conduct as Commanding Officer of Motor Torpedo Boat 109 following the collision and sinking of that vessel in the Pacific War Theater on August 1&ndash;2, 1943. Unmindful of personal danger, Lieutenant (thenLieutenant, Junior Grade) Kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations, swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore. His outstanding courage, endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.In October 1943, Kennedy took command of a PT boat converted into a gunboat,PT-59, which took part in a Marine rescue onChoiseul Islandthat November.[31]Kennedy then left thePT-59and returned to the United States in early January 1944. After receiving treatment for his back injury, he was released from active duty in late 1944.[32]Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury atCastle Hot Springs, a resort and temporary military hospital inArizona.[33][34]Kennedy was honorably discharged just prior to Japan's surrender in 1945. Kennedy's other decorations in World War II included thePurple Heart,American Defense Service Medal,American Campaign Medal,Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medalwith threebronze service stars, and theWorld War II Victory Medal.[1]When later asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: "It was easy. They cut my PT boat in half."[35]In April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend ofWilliam Randolph Hearst, arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent forHearst Newspapers; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and "expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career."[36]He worked as a correspondent that May, covering thePotsdam Conferenceand other events.[37]Congressional careerU.S. House of Representatives (1947&ndash;1953)While Kennedy was still serving, his older brother,Joe Jr.was killed in action over the English Channel during World War II. Because his eldest brother had been thefamily's political standard-bearerand tapped by his father to seek the Presidency, his death changed that course and the task now fell to Kennedy.[38]In 1946, U.S. RepresentativeJames Michael Curleyvacated his seat in the strongly Democratic 11th Congressional district in Massachusetts&mdash;at the urging of Kennedy's father&mdash;to become mayor of Boston. Kennedy ran for the seat, beating his Republican opponent by a large margin in November 1946.[39]He served as a congressman for six years.U.S. Senate (1953&ndash;1960)Kennedy lying on a gurney following spinal surgery, accompanied by his wife, December 1954.In the1952 U.S. Senate election, Kennedy defeated incumbent RepublicanHenry Cabot Lodge IIfor the U.S. Senate seat. The following year, he marriedJacqueline Bouvier.[40]Kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years. Often absent from the Senate, he was at times critically ill and received Catholiclast rites. During his convalescence in 1956, he publishedProfiles in Courage, a book about U.S. Senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won thePulitzer Prize for Biographyin 1957.[41]Rumors that this work was co-written by his close adviser andspeechwriter,Ted Sorensen, were confirmed in Sorensen's 2008 autobiography.[42]At the1956 Democratic National Convention, Presidential nomineeAdlai Stevensonlet the convention select the Vice Presential nominee. Kennedy finished second in the balloting, losing to SenatorEstes Kefauverof Tennessee. Kennedy received national exposure from that episode; his father thought it just as well that Kennedy lost, due to the potential political debility of his Catholicism and the strength of the Eisenhower ticket.One of the matters demanding Kennedy's attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower's bill for theCivil Rights Act of 1957.[43]Kennedy cast a procedural vote on this, which was considered by some as an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill.[43]Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin, but Majority LeaderLyndon B. Johnsonagreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure.[44]Kennedy also voted for Title IV, termed the "Jury Trial Amendment". Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act.[45]A final compromise bill, which Kennedy supported, was passed in September 1957.[46]Jack Paarinterviews Senator Kennedy onThe Tonight Show(1959).In 1958, Kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the Senate, defeating his Republican opponent, Boston lawyer Vincent J. Celeste, by a wide margin. It was during his re-election campaign that Kennedy's press secretary at this time,Robert E. Thompson, put together a film entitledThe U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy Story, which exhibited a day in the life of the Senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner-workings of his office. It was the most comprehensive film produced about Kennedy up to that time.[47]While Kennedy's father was a strong supporter of SenatorJoseph McCarthy, McCarthy was also a friend of the Kennedy family. As well, Bobby Kennedy worked for McCarthy's subcommittee, and McCarthy dated Kennedy sister Patricia. In 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. The speech, however, was not delivered, because of Kennedy's hospitalization at the time. The speech had the potential of putting Kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by "pairing" his vote against that of another senator. Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged Kennedy's support among members of theliberalcommunity, includingEleanor Roosevelt, in the 1956 and 1960 elections.[48]1960 presidential electionMain article:United States presidential election, 1960John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon participate in the first televised presidential debate in Washington, D.C. in 1960.On January 2, 1960, Kennedy initiated his campaign for president in the Democraticprimary election, where he faced challenges from SenatorHubert HumphreyofMinnesotaand SenatorWayne MorseofOregon. Kennedy defeated Humphrey inWisconsinandWest Virginia, Morse inMarylandand Oregon, as well as token opposition (oftenwrite-in candidates) inNew Hampshire,Indiana, andNebraska.Kennedy visited a coal mine in West Virginia. Most miners and others in that predominantlyconservative,Protestantstate were quite wary of Kennedy's Roman Catholicism. His victory in West Virginia confirmed his broad popular appeal.At the Democratic Convention, he gave his well-known "New Frontier" speech, saying: "For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won&mdash;and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier..... But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises&mdash;it is a set of challenges. It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people, but what I intend to ask of them."[49]With Humphrey and Morse eliminated, Kennedy's main opponent at the Los Angeles convention was SenatorLyndon B. Johnsonof Texas. Kennedy overcame this formal challenge as well as informal ones fromAdlai Stevenson(the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956),Stuart Symington, and severalfavorite sons, and on July 13 the Democratic convention nominated Kennedy as its candidate. Kennedy asked Johnson to be his vice presidential candidate, despite opposition from many liberal delegates and Kennedy's own staff, including his brother Bobby.[50]The Kennedys campaigning inAppleton, Wisconsin, March 1960.Kennedy needed Johnson's strength in theSouthto win what was considered likely to be the closest election since1916. Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Roman Catholicism,Cuba, and whether theSovietspace and missile programs had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision-making, he famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, "I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters&#160;&ndash; and the Church does not speak for me."[51]Kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic, and once stated that, "No one asked me my religion [serving the Navy] in the South Pacific."[52]OutgoingPresidentDwight D. Eisenhowermeets withPresident-electJohn F. Kennedy on December 6, 1960During the campaign, Kennedy sought a meeting with RabbiMenachem M. Schneerson, at his office on Brooklyn. Kennedy was turned down as the rabbi was already meeting a group of simple men and women that evening.[53][54]In September and October, Kennedy appeared with Republican candidateRichard Nixon, then vice president, in the first televisedU.S. presidential debatesin U.S. history. During these programs, Nixon, with a sore injured leg and his "five o'clock shadow", was perspiring and looked tense and uncomfortable, while Kennedy, choosing to avail himself of makeup services, appeared relaxed, leading the huge television audience to favor Kennedy as the winner. Radio listeners either thought Nixon had won or that the debates were a draw.[55]The debates are now considered a milestone in American political history&mdash;the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics.[41]Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls. On November 8, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in theElectoral Collegehe won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[56]Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for thecivil rights movement; they voted for SenatorHarry F. Byrdof Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[56]Kennedy was the youngest man elected president, succeeding Eisenhower, who was then the oldest (Ronald Reagansurpassed Eisenhower as the oldest president in 1981).[57]Presidency (1961&ndash;1963)Wikisourcehas original text related to this article:John F. Kennedy's Inaugural AddressSee also:Timeline of the presidency of John F. KennedyThis section'stone or style may not reflect theencyclopedic toneused on Wikipedia.See Wikipedia'sguide to writing better articlesfor suggestions.(April 2015)John F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961. Inhis inaugural addresshe spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens, famously saying, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the "common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself".[58]John F. Kennedy takesthe oath of officeadministered byChief JusticeEarl Warrenon January 20, 1961, atthe CapitolHe added: "All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin." In closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: "Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you."[58]John F. Kennedy speaking at Rice University on September 12, 1962The address reflected Kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart an historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration.[59]Kennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former-general Eisenhower; and he wasted no time in dismantling Eisenhower's methods.[60]Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel, with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. "We can learn our jobs together", he stated.[61]Much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda.[62]The president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration, and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings. Deputy national security advisorWalt Whitman Rostowonce began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and Kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, "What do you want me to do about that today?"[63]Kennedy approved Defense secretaryRobert McNamara's controversial decision to award the contract for theF-111TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) fighter-bomber toGeneral Dynamics(the choice of the civilian Defense department) overBoeing(the choice of the military).[64]At the request of SenatorHenry Jackson, SenatorJohn McClellanheld 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before thePermanent Subcommittee on Investigationsinvestigating the TFX contract from February&ndash;November 1963.[65]Foreign policyMain article:Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administrationForeign trips of John F. Kennedy during his presidencyPresident Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with theSoviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of theCold War. In 1961, Kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with SovietPremierNikita Khrushchev. The president started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into theVienna Summitof June 1961.[66]On the way to the summit, Kennedy stopped in Paris to meetCharles de Gaulle, who advised Kennedy to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style. The French president feared the United States' presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris, saying that he would be remembered as "the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris."[67]Kennedy withKwame Nkrumah, the first head of an independentGhana, March 1961On June 4, 1961, the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the Premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence, but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow andEast Berlin. He made it clear that any such treaty which interfered with U.S access rights inWest Berlinwould be regarded as an act of war.[68]Persian ShahMohammad Reza Pahlavi, Kennedy, andU.S. Defense SecretaryRobert McNamarain theWhite House Cabinet Roomon April 13, 1962.Shortly after the president returned home, the U.S.S.R. announced its intention to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Kennedy, depressed and angry, assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.[69]In the weeks immediately after the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the USSR. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, whereDean Achesontook the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.[70]In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25&#160;billion to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.[71]The following month, the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to theBerlin Wall. Kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from West to East Berlin continued. This course was altered when it was learned that the West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States. Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through West Germany, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U.S. to West Berlin.[72]Kennedy gave a speech atSaint Anselm Collegeon May 5, 1960, regarding America's conduct in the emerging Cold War. The address detailed how American foreign policy should be conducted towards African nations, noting a hint of support for modern African nationalism by saying that "For we, too, founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule".[73]Cuba and the Bay of Pigs InvasionMain article:Bay of Pigs InvasionPresident Kennedy and Vice President Johnson take a leisurely stroll on the White House groundsThe prior Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow theFidel Castroregime in Cuba. The plan, led by theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) with help from the U.S. military, was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained anti-Castro Cuban exiles[74][75]led by CIA paramilitary officers. The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people in hopes of removing Castro from power.[76]On April 17, 1961, Kennedy ordered what became known as the "Bay of Pigs Invasion": 1,500 U.S.-trained Cubans, called "Brigade 2506", landed on the island. No U.S. air support was provided.Allen Dulles,director of the CIA, later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action required for success once the troops were on the ground.[77]By April 19, 1961, the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53&#160;million worth of food and medicine.[78]The incident made Castro wary of the U.S. and led him to believe another invasion would occur.[79]According to biographerRichard Reeves, Kennedy primarily focused on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it failed, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.[80]He took responsibility for the failure, saying, "We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it."[81]In late 1961, the White House formed the "Special Group (Augmented)", headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale, SecretaryRobert McNamara, and others. The group's objective&mdash;to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics&mdash;was never pursued.[82]Cuban Missile CrisisMain article:Cuban Missile CrisisOn October 14, 1962, CIAU-2spy planes took photographs of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites being built in Cuba by the Soviets. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.[83]Meeting with Soviet PremierNikita KhrushchevinViennain 1961.Kennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead tonuclear warwith the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons. The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[84]Address on the Buildup of Arms in CubaSorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.Kennedy addressing the nation on October 22, 1962, about the buildup of arms on CubaProblems playing this file? Seemedia help.More than a third of the members of theNational Security Council(NSC) favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of "Pearl Harbor in reverse".[85]There was also some reaction from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of U.S. missiles that had been placed in Turkey by Eisenhower. There could also be no assurance that the assault would be 100% effective.[86]In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine. On October 22 he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced the decision on TV.[87]The U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. TheOrganization of American Statesgave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. The president exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[88]United Nations(UN) Secretary GeneralU Thantrequested that both parties reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev said yes, but Kennedy said no.[89]One Soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded. On October 28 Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[90]The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its missiles in Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped withUGM-27 Polarismissiles.[91]This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since. In the end, "the humanity" of the two men prevailed.[92]The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[93]Latin America and communismMain article:Kennedy and Latin AmericaPresident John F. Kennedy with Chilean PresidentJorge Alessandri, on an official visit in December 1962.Arguing that "those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable,"[94]Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism inLatin Americaby establishing theAlliance for Progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greaterhuman rightsstandards in the region.[95]He worked closely withGovernor of Puerto RicoLuis Muńoz Marínfor the development of the Alliance of Progress, and began working towards the autonomy of the Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico.When the president took office, the Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating plans for the assassination of Castro in Cuba andRafael Trujilloin theDominican Republic. Kennedy privately instructed the CIA that any such planning must include plausible deniability by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.[96]In June 1961 the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following the event, Undersecretary of StateChester Bowlesled a cautious reaction by the nation. Robert Kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the U.S., called Bowles "a gutless bastard" to his face.[97]Peace CorpsExecutive Order 10924Establishment of the Peace CorpsSorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.John F. Kennedy's announcement of the establishment of thePeace CorpsProblems playing this file? Seemedia help.As one of his first presidential acts, Kennedy asked Congress to create thePeace Corps. His brother-in-law,Sargent Shriver, was the first director.[98]Through this program, Americans volunteer to help underdeveloped nations in areas such as education, farming, health care, and construction. The organization grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the following year.[99]Since 1961, over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps, serving in 139 countries.[100][101]Southeast AsiaMain articles:1963 South Vietnamese coup,Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem,Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup,Cable 243,Buddhist crisis,Thích Qu?ng ??c,Xá L?i Pagoda raids,Krulak Mendenhall missionandMcNamara Taylor missionWhen briefing Kennedy, Eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower consideredLaosto be "the cork in the bottle" in regards to the regional threat. In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a "free" Laos to a "neutral" Laos, indicating privately thatVietnam, and not Laos, should be deemed America's tripwire for communism's spread in the area.[102]In May 1961 he dispatched Lyndon Johnson to meet with South Vietnam's PresidentNgo Dinh Diem. Johnson assured Diem more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists.[103]Kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with Diem in defeat of communism inSouth Vietnam.[104]Kennedy initially followed Eisenhower's lead, using limited military action to fight the communist forces led byHo Chi Minh.[105]He continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the South Vietnamese government.[105]Late in 1961, theViet Congbegan assuming a predominant presence, initially seizing the provincial capital of Phuoc Vinh.[106]Kennedy increased the number of helicopters, military advisors, and undeclaredU.S. Special Forcesin the area, but he was reluctant to order a full-scale deployment of troops.[107][108]In late 1961, President Kennedy sentRoger Hilsman, then director of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, to assess the situation in Vietnam. There, Hilsman metSir Robert Thompson, head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam and the concept of theStrategic Hamlet Programwas formed. It was approved by Kennedy and South Vietnam PresidentNgo Dinh Diem. It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents. It was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. By November 1963 the program waned and officially ended in 1964.[109]In early 1962, Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the "National Security Action Memorandum&#160;&ndash; Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation)".[110]Secretary of StateDean Ruskvoiced strong support for U.S. involvement.[111]"Operation Ranch Hand", a large-scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of South Vietnam.[112][b]Kennedy with futureAustralian Prime MinisterHarold Holtinthe Oval Officein 1963.In April 1963, Kennedy assessed the situation in Vietnam: "We don't have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate us. They are going to throw our asses out of there at any point. But I can't give up that territory to the communists and get the American people to re-elect me".[113]Kennedy faced a crisis in Vietnam by July; despite increased U.S. support, the South Vietnamese military was only marginally effective against pro-communist Viet Cong forces.On August 21, just as the new U.S. AmbassadorHenry Cabot Lodge, Jr.arrived, Diem and his brotherNgo Dinh Nhuordered South Vietnam forces, funded and trained by the CIA, to quell Buddhist demonstrations. The crackdowns heightened expectations of acoup d'étatto remove Diem with (or perhaps by) his brother, Nhu.[114]Lodge was instructed to try to get Diem and Nhu to step down and leave the country. Diem would not listen to Lodge.[115]Cable 243(DEPTEL 243), dated August 24, followed, declaring Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu's actions, and Lodge was ordered to pressure Diem to remove Nhu. If Diem refused, the Americans would explore alternative leadership.[116]Lodge stated that the only workable option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and Nhu, as originally planned.[117]At week's end, Kennedy learned from Lodge that the Diem government might, due to France's assistance to Nhu, be dealing secretly with the communists&mdash;and might ask the Americans to leave; orders were sent to Saigon and throughout Washington to "destroy all coup cables".[118]At the same time, the first formal anti-Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by U.S. clergy from the Ministers' Vietnam Committee.[119]A White House meeting in September was indicative of the very different ongoing appraisals; the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the Department of Defense (GeneralVictor Krulak) and the State Department (Joseph Mendenhall). Krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any U.S. influence. Kennedy reacted, saying, "Did you two gentlemen visit the same country?" The president was unaware that the two men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight.[120]In October 1963, the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and GeneralMaxwell D. Taylorto a Vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. The objective of theMcNamara Taylor mission"emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam".[121]In meetings with McNamara, Taylor, and Lodge, Diem again refused to agree to governing measures insisted upon by the U.S., helping to dispel McNamara's previous optimism about Diem.[122]Taylor and McNamara were also enlightened by Vietnam's vice president,Nguyen Ngoc Tho(choice of many to succeed Diem should a coup occur), who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside.[123]At Kennedy's insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the NSC considered a strategic fantasy.[124]The final report declared that the military was making progress, that the increasingly unpopular Diem-led government was not vulnerable to a coup, and that an assassination of Diem or Nhu was a possibility.[125]In late October, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot. The source, Vietnamese GeneralDuong Van Minh(also known as "Big Minh"), wanted to know the U.S. position. Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination, and to ensure deniability by the U.S.[126]Later that month, as the coup became imminent, Kennedy ordered all cables to be routed through him. A policy of "control and cut out" was initiated to insure presidential control of U.S. responses, while cutting him out of the paper trail.[127]On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by "Big Minh",overthrew the Diem government, arrestingand then killing Diem and Nhu. Kennedy was shocked by the deaths. He found out afterwards that Minh had asked the CIA field office to secure safe-passage out of the country for Diem and Nhu, but was told that 24 hours were needed to procure a plane. Minh responded that he could not hold them that long.[128]News of the coup initially led to renewed confidence&mdash;both in America and in South Vietnam&mdash;that the war might be won.[129]McGeorge Bundydrafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas. It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia. Before leaving for Dallas, Kennedy toldMichael Forrestalthat "after the first of the year&#160;... [he wanted] an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there&#160;... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top". When asked what he thought the president meant, Forrestal said, "it was devil's advocate stuff."[130]Historians disagree on whether Vietnam would have escalated had Kennedy survived and been re-elected in 1964.[131]Fueling the debate are statements made by Secretary of Defense McNamara in the film "The Fog of War" that Kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of Vietnam after the 1964 election.[132]The film also contains a tape recording of Lyndon Johnson stating that Kennedy was planning to withdraw, a position that Johnson disagreed with.[133]Kennedy had signed National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 263, dated October 11, which ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by the end of the year.[134][135]Such an action would have been a policy reversal, but Kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his acclaimed speech about world peace atAmerican Universityon June 10, 1963.[136]When Robert Kennedy was asked in 1964 what his brother would have done if the South Vietnamese had been on the brink of defeat, he replied, "We'd face that when we came to it."[137]At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam.[138]U.S. involvement in the region escalated until Lyndon Johnson, his successor, directly deployed regular U.S. military forces for fighting theVietnam War.[139][140]After Kennedy's assassination, President Johnson passed NSAM 273 on November 26, 1963. It reversed Kennedy's decision to withdraw 1,000 troops, and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the South Vietnamese.[141][142]American University speechKennedy delivers thecommencement speechatAmerican University, June 10, 1963Wikisourcehas original text related to this article:A Strategy of PeaceWorld PeaceSpeechSorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.Speech fromAmerican Universityby John F.

Also known as "Strategy of Peace", Kennedy not only outlined a plan to curb nuclear arms, but also "laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S. and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race."[144]The President wished "to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived&mdash;yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace&#160;... I speak of peace because of the new face of war...in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the Second World War&#160;... an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn&#160;... I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men&#160;... world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor&mdash;it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance&#160;... our problems are man-made&mdash;therefore they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants."[145]The president also made two announcements&mdash;that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and that the U.S had postponed planned atmospheric tests.[146]West Berlin speechIch bin ein Berliner(I am a Berliner) speechPlay mediaIch bin ein Berlinerspeech from theRathaus Schönebergby John F.

He was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience.[152]Kennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism: "Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us." The speech is known for its famous phrase"Ich bin ein Berliner"("I am a citizen of Berlin"). A million people were on the street for the speech.[152]He remarked toTed Sorensenafterwards: "We'll never have another day like this one, as long as we live."[153]IsraelIn 1960, Kennedy stated: "Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom".[154]Subsequently as president, Kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with Israel, and he is credited as the founder of the US-Israeli military alliance (which would be continued under subsequent presidents). Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a 'special relationship' (as he described it toGolda Meir) between the US and Israel.[155]Kennedy (right) withIsraeli Foreign MinisterGolda Meir, December 27, 1962.Kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to Israel in 1962 and, beginning in 1963, was the first US president to allow the sale to Israel of advanced US weaponry (theMIM-23 Hawk), as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies which were opposed by Arab neighbours; such as its water project on the Jordan River.[156]As result of this newly created security alliance, Kennedy also encountered tensions with the Israeli government regarding the production of nuclear materials inDimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East. After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the Israeli government,David Ben-Gurionstated in a speech to the IsraeliKnesseton December 21, 1960, that the purpose of the nuclear plant atBeershebawas for "research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna".[157]When Ben-Gurion met with Kennedy in New York, he claimed that Dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes "for the time being".[157]When Kennedy wrote that he was skeptical, and stated in a May 1963 letter to Ben-Gurion that American support to Israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the Israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, Ben-Gurion repeated previous reassurances that Dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes. The Israeli government resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities toInternational Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) inspections. In 1962, the US and Israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime. A science attaché at the embassy in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of the Dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead American scientists when they visited.[158]According toSeymour Hersh, the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the Americans. Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg stated, "It was part of my job to tip them off that Kennedy was insisting on [an inspection]."[158]Hersh contends the inspections were conducted in such a way that it "guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as the president and his senior advisors had to understand: the American inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence of Israel.".[159]Marc Trachtenbergargued: "Although well aware of what the Israelis were doing, Kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of Israeli compliance with America's non-proliferation policy."[160]The American who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find "ways to not reach the point of taking action against Israel's nuclear weapons program".[161]Rodger Davies, the director of the State Department's Office of Near Eastern Affairs, concluded in March 1965 that Israel was developingnuclear weapons. He reported that Israel's target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968&ndash;69.[162]On May 1, 1968, Undersecretary of StateNicholas Katzenbachtold President Johnson that Dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year. The State Department argued that if Israel wanted arms, it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program.[158]Dimona was never placed under IAEA safeguards. Attempts to write Israeli adherence to theNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty(NPT) into contracts for the supply of U.S. weapons continued throughout 1968.[163]IraqMain article:Ramadan RevolutionIn 1963, the Kennedy administration backed thecoup against the government of Iraqheaded byAbd al-Karim Qasim, who five years earlier had deposed the Western-alliedIraqi monarchy.[164]On February 8, 1963, Kennedy received a memo stating: "We will make informal friendly noises as soon as we can find out whom to talk with, and ought to recognize as soon as we're sure these guys are firmly in the saddle. CIA had excellent reports on the plotting, but I doubt either they or UK should claim much credit for it."[165]The CIA had planned to remove Qasim in the past, but those efforts did not come to fruition.[166]The new government, led by PresidentAbdul Salam Arifand dominated by theBa'ath Party(along with a coalition ofNasseristsandIraqi nationalists), used lists&mdash;possibly provided by the CIA&mdash;of suspected communists and other leftists to systematically murder unknown numbers of Iraq's educated elite.[167][168]After a power struggle with the Ba'athist Prime Minister,Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, Arifpurged the Ba'ath Party from the government.[169]Former CIA officer James Chritchfield disputed the notion that the CIA offered "active support" to the coup plotters, arguing that while "well-informed" on the first coup, it was "surprised" by the power struggles that followed.[170]IrelandJohn F. Kennedy visiting the John Barry Memorial at Crescent Quay in Wexford, Ireland.President Kennedy in motorcade in Patrick Street,Cork, inIrelandon June 28, 1963.During his four-day visit to his ancestral home ofIrelandin June 1963,[171]Kennedy accepted a grant ofarmorial bearingsfrom theChief Herald of Irelandand received honorary degrees from theNational University of IrelandandTrinity College, Dublin.[172]He visited the cottage at Dunganstown, nearNew Ross,County Wexfordwhere his ancestors had lived before emigrating to America.[173]He also became the first foreign leader to address theHouses of the Oireachtas(the Irish parliament).[174]On December 22, 2006, the IrishDepartment of Justicereleased declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as Kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit.[175]Nuclear Test Ban TreatyMain article:Partial Nuclear Test Ban TreatyTroubled by the long-term dangers ofradioactive contaminationandnuclear weapons proliferation, Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived inAdlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign.[176]In theirVienna summitmeeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September. The United States responded by conducting tests five days later.[177]Shortly thereafter, new U.S. satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race.[178]Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the U.S.S.R. perceived themselves to be at parity.[179]In July 1963, Kennedy sentW. Averell Harrimanto Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.[180]The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation toAndrei Gromyko. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.[181]Ultimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate ratified this and Kennedy signed it into law in October 1963. France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.[182]Domestic policyPresident Kennedy inFort Worth, Texason Friday morning, November 22, 1963.Kennedy called his domestic program the "New Frontier". It ambitiously promised federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession. Kennedy also promised an end toracial discrimination.[183]In his 1963State of the Union address, he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20&ndash;90% to a range of 14&ndash;65%; he proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47%. Kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70% if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners.[183]Congress did not act until 1964, after his death, when the top individual rate was lowered to 70%, and the top corporate rate was set at 48% (seeRevenue Act of 1964).[184]To theEconomic Club of New York, he spoke in 1963 of "...&#160;the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low; and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now."[185]Congress passed few of Kennedy's major programs during his lifetime, but did vote them through in 1964&ndash;65 under his successor Johnson.[186]EconomyKennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keepinterest ratesdown and encourage growth of the economy.[187]He presided over the first government budget to top the $100&#160;billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 led to the country's first non-war, non-recessiondeficit.[188]The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably during his presidency. Despite low inflation and interest rates,GDPhad grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower presidency (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office.[189]The economy turned around and prospered during the Kennedy administration. GDP expanded by an average of 5.5% from early 1961 to late 1963,[189]while inflation remained steady at around 1% and unemployment eased.[190]Industrial production rose by 15% and motor vehicle sales rose by 40%.[191]This rate of growth in GDP and industry continued until around 1969, and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time.[189]Bobby Kennedy stated, "We're going for broke..... their expense accounts, where they've been and what they've been doing..... the FBI is to interview them all..... we can't lose this."[192]Robert took the position thatthe steel executiveshad illegally colluded to fix prices. The administration's actions influencedU.S. Steelto rescind the price increase.[193]The Wall Street Journalwrote that the administration had acted "by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police."[194]Yale law professorCharles Reichopined inThe New Republicthat the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict U.S. Steel for collusion so quickly.[194]ANew York Timeseditorial praised Kennedy's actions and said that the steel industry's price increase "imperils the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation."[195]Nevertheless, the administration's Bureau of Budget reported the price increase would have resulted in a net gain for GDP as well as a net budget surplus.[196]The stock market, which had steadily declined since Kennedy's election, dropped 10% shortly after the administration's action on the steel industry.[197]Federal and military death penaltyAs president, Kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior toFurman v. Georgia, a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions.[198]Victor Feguerwas sentenced to death by a federal court in Iowa and was executed on March 15, 1963.[199]Kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman Jimmie Henderson on February 12, 1962, changing the penalty to life in prison.[200]On March 22, 1962, Kennedy signed into law HR5143 (PL87-423), abolishing the mandatory death penalty forfirst degree murderin the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty.[201]The death penalty has not been applied in the District of Columbia since 1957, and has now been abolished.[202]Civil rightsThe turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s.Jim Crowsegregationwas the established law in theDeep South.[203]TheSupreme Court of the United Stateshad ruled in 1954 inBrown v. Board of Educationthatracial segregationin public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court's decision. The Court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless.[204]Kennedy verbally supportedracial integrationand civil rights; during the 1960 campaign he telephonedCoretta Scott King, wife of the ReverendMartin Luther King, Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter. Robert Kennedy called Georgia governorErnest Vandiverand obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother's candidacy.[204]In his first State of the Union Address in January 1961, President Kennedy said "The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race - at the ballot box and elsewhere - disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage."[205]Kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, which was dominated by conservative Southern Democrats, and he distanced himself from it.[206]Kennedy also was more concerned with other issues early in his presidency, such as theCold War, Bay of Pigs fiasco and the situation in Southeast Asia. As articulated by brother Robert, the administration's early priority was to "keep the president out of this civil rights mess". Many civil rights leaders viewed Kennedy as lukewarm, especially concerning theFreedom Riders, who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south, and who were repeatedly met with violence by whites, including law enforcement officers, both federal and state. Kennedy assignedfederal marshalsto protect the Freedom Riders as an alternative to using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents. Robert Kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the Freedom Riders to "get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts."[207]On March 6, 1961, Kennedy signedExecutive Order 10925which required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."[208]It established thePresident's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Displeased with the pace of Kennedy's addressing the issue of segregation, Martin Luther King, Jr. and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps ofAbraham Lincolnand use an Executive Order to deliver a blow for Civil Rights as a kind ofSecond Emancipation Proclamation- Kennedy did not execute the order.[209]In September 1962,James Meredithenrolled at theUniversity of Mississippi, but was prevented from entering. Attorney General Robert Kennedy responded by sending 400 federal marshals, while President Kennedy reluctantly sent 3,000 troops after the situation on campus turned violent.[210]TheOle Miss riot of 1962left two dead and dozens injured, but Meredith did finally enroll in his first class. The instigating subculture at the Old Miss riot and at many other racially ignited events, was theKu Klux Klan.[211]On November 20, 1962, Kennedy signedExecutive Order 11063, prohibiting racial discrimination in federally supported housing or "related facilities".[212]In early 1963, Kennedy related to Martin Luther King, Jr., about the prospects for civil rights legislation: "If we get into a long fight over this in Congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill."[213]Civil rights clashes were on the rise that year.[214]Brother Robert and Ted Sorenson pressed Kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front.[215]President Kennedy'sCivil Rights Address, June 11, 1963.On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy intervened when Alabama GovernorGeorge Wallaceblocked thedoorwayto theUniversity of Alabamato stop two African American students,Vivian MaloneandJames Hood, from attending. Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney GeneralNicholas Katzenbachand the AlabamaNational Guard, which had just been federalized by order of the president. That evening Kennedy gave his famouscivil rights addresson national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation&mdash;to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.[216][217]His proposals became part of theCivil Rights Act of 1964. The day ended with the murder of a NAACP leader,Medgar Evers, in front of his home in Mississippi.[218]As the president had predicted, the day after his TV speech, and in reaction to it, House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia (Area Redevelopment Administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans.[219]Earlier, Kennedy had signed the executive order creating thePresidential Commission on the Status of Womenon December 14, 1961.[220]Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission. The Commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination; their final report documenting legal and cultural barriers was issued in October 1963.[221]Further, on June 10, 1963, Kennedy signed theEqual Pay Act of 1963, a federal law amending theFair Labor Standards Act, aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex.[222]Kennedy meets with leaders of theMarch on Washingtonin the Oval Office, August 28, 1963.Over a hundred thousand, predominantly African Americans, gathered in Washington for the civil rightsMarch on Washington for Jobs and Freedomon August 28, 1963. Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the N.A.A.C.P. and Martin Luther King'sSouthern Christian Leadership Conference(SCLC).[223]To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00&#160;pm. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a "triumph of managed protest", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.[223]Nevertheless, the struggle was far from over. Three weeks later,a bomb explodedon Sunday, September 15 at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion and two other children shot to death in the aftermath.[224]Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee.[225]Civil libertiesIn 1963, FBI DirectorJ. Edgar Hoover, who hated civil-rights leaderMartin Luther King, Jr.and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker,[226]presented the Kennedy Administration with allegations that some of King's close confidants and advisers were communists. Concerned that the allegations, if made public, would derail the Administration's civil rights initiatives, Robert Kennedy and the president both warned King to discontinue the suspect associations. After the associations continued, Robert Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of theSouthern Christian Leadership Conference, King's civil rights organization.[227]Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones "on a trial basis, for a month or so",[228]Hoover extended the clearance so his men were "unshackled" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.[229]The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968.[230]ImmigrationJohn F. Kennedy initially proposed an overhaul of American immigration policy that later was to become theImmigration and Nationality Act of 1965, sponsored by Kennedy's brother SenatorEdward Kennedy. It dramatically shifted the source of immigration from Northern and Western European countries towards immigration from Latin America and Asia. The policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification.[231]Kennedy wanted to dismantle the selection of immigrants based on country of origin and saw this as an extension of his civil rights policies.[232]Native American relationsFurther information:Kinzua Dam § Native AmericansandSeneca nation § Kinzua DamConstruction of theKinzua Damflooded 10,000 acres (4,047&#160;ha) ofSeneca nationland that they had occupied under theTreaty of 1794, and forced 600 Seneca to relocate toSalamanca, New York. Kennedy was asked by theAmerican Civil Liberties Unionto intervene and halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control. He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca, and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate their displacement.[233][234]Space policyFurther information:Space RaceandSpace policy of the United StatesTheApollo programwas conceived early in 1960, during theEisenhoweradministration, as a follow-up toProject Mercury, to be used as a shuttle to an Earth-orbitalspace station, flights around the Moon, or landing on it. WhileNASAwent ahead with planning for Apollo, funding for the program was far from certain, given Eisenhower's ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight.[235]As Senator, Kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it.[236]In constructing his Presidential administration, Kennedy elected to retain Eisenhower's last science advisorJerome Wiesneras head of thePresident's Science Advisory Committee. Wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration,[237]having issued a report highly critical of Project Mercury.[238][239]Kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for NASA administrator before the post was accepted byJames E. Webb, an experienced Washington insider who served PresidentHarry S. Trumanas budget director and undersecretary of State. Webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of Congress, the President, and the American people.[240]Kennedy also persuaded Congress to amend theNational Aeronautics and Space Actto allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the National Aeronautics and Space Council to the Vice President,[240][241]both because of the knowledge of the space program Johnson gained in the Senate working forthe creation of NASA, and to help keep the politically savvy Johnson occupied.[240]In Kennedy's January 1961 State of the Union address, he had suggested international cooperation in space. Khrushchev declined, as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities.[242]Early in his presidency, Kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program, but postponed any decision out of deference to Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the Senate.[236]Kennedy's advisors speculated that a Moon flight would be prohibitively expensive,[243]and he was considering plans to dismantle the Apollo program due to its cost.[244]Kennedy proposing a program to land men on the Moon to Congress in May 1961.However, this quickly changed on April 12, 1961, when Soviet cosmonautYuri Gagarinbecame the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union.[245]Kennedy now became eager for the U.S. to take the lead in theSpace Race, for reasons of strategy and prestige. On April 20, he sent a memo to Johnson, asking him to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up.[246][247]After consulting withWernher von Braun, Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that "we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership."[248][249]His memo concluded that a manned Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first.[248]Kennedy's advisorTed Sorensenadvised him to support the Moon landing, and on May 25, Kennedy announced the goal in a speech titledSpecial Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs:"... I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish."[250]Full text&#160;Play mediaKennedy speaks at Rice University, September 12, 1962 (duration 17:47)After Congress authorized the funding, Webb began reorganizing NASA, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers: aLaunch Operations Centerfor thelarge Moon rocketnorthwest ofCape Canaveral Air Force Station, and aManned Spacecraft Centeron land donated throughRice UniversityinHouston, Texas. Kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver anotherspeechat Rice to promote the space effort on September 12, 1962, in which he said:"No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ...&#160;We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard."[251]Full text&#160;On November 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with NASA administrator Webb and other officials, Kennedy explained that the Moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified.[252]Johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well. Costs for the Apollo program were expected to reach $40 billion.[253]In a September 1963 speech before the United Nations, Kennedy urged cooperation between the Soviets and Americans in space, specifically recommending that Apollo be switched to "a joint expedition to the Moon".[254]Khrushchev again declined, and the Soviets did not commit to a manned Moon mission until 1964.[255]On July 20, 1969, almost six years after Kennedy's death,Apollo 11landed the first manned spacecraft on the Moon.AssassinationThe Kennedys and the Connallys in the presidential limousine moments before theassassinationin Dallas.Main article:Assassination of John F. KennedyPresident Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30&#160;pmCentral Standard Timeon Friday November 22, 1963, while on a political trip to Texas to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberalsRalph YarboroughandDon Yarborough(no relation) and conservativeJohn Connally.[256]Traveling in a presidentialmotorcadethrough downtown Dallas, he was shot once in the throat,[257]and once in the head.[257]Kennedy was taken to Parkland Hospital for emergency medical treatment, but pronounced dead at 1:00&#160;pm. Only 46, President Kennedy died younger than any other U.S. president to date.Lee Harvey Oswald, an employee of theTexas School Book Depositoryfrom which the shots were suspected to have been fired, was arrested for the murder of a local police officer, and was subsequently charged with the assassination of Kennedy. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was apatsy,[258][259]but was killed byJack Rubyon November 24, before he could be tried. Ruby was then arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.President Johnson created theWarren Commission&mdash;chaired by Chief JusticeEarl Warren&mdash;to investigate the assassination, which concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin. The results of this investigation are disputed by many.[260]The assassination proved to be an important moment inU.S. historybecause of its impact on the nation and the ensuing political repercussions. A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been aconspiracy to kill President Kennedy, while 74% thought there had been a cover-up.[261]AGallup Pollin mid-November 2013, showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought Oswald did it alone.[262]In 1979, theU.S. House Select Committee on Assassinationsconcluded that it believed "that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of aconspiracy. The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy."[263]FuneralMain article:State funeral of John F. KennedyPresident Kennedy's family leaving hisfuneralat theU.S. Capitol BuildingARequiem Masswas held for Kennedy at theCathedral of St. Matthew the Apostleon November 25, 1963. Afterwards, Kennedy's body was buried in a small plot, (20&#160;by 30&#160;ft.), inArlington National Cemetery. Over a period of three years (1964&ndash;66), an estimated 16&#160;million people had visited his grave. On March 14, 1967, Kennedy's body was moved to a permanent burial plot and memorial at the cemetery. The funeral was officiated by FatherJohn J. Cavanaugh.[264]It was from this memorial that the graves of bothBobbyandTedwere modeled.Thehonor guardat Kennedy's graveside was the 37th Cadet Class of theIrish Army. Kennedy was greatly impressed by the Irish Cadets on his last official visit to Ireland, so much so that Jackie Kennedy requested the Irish Army to be the honor guard at her husband's funeral.[265]Kennedy's wife,Jacquelineand their two deceased minor children were buried with him later. His brother, Senator Robert Kennedy,was buried nearbyin June 1968. In August 2009, his brother, SenatorEdward M. Kennedy, was also buried near his two brothers. John F. Kennedy's grave is lit with an "Eternal Flame". Kennedy andWilliam Howard Taftare the only two U.S. presidents buried at Arlington.[266][267]According to theJFK Library, "I Have a Rendezvous with Death", byAlan Seeger"was one of John F.

Bartlett, a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party.[269]They were married a year after he was elected senator, on September 12, 1953.[270]TheKennedy familyis one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, and multiple other Representatives, both on the federal and state level. Family patriarch, Joe Kennedy, was a prominent American businessman and political figure, serving in multiple roles, includingAmbassador to the United Kingdom, from 1938 to 1940.In October 1951, during his third term asMassachusetts's 11th districtcongressman, the then 34-year-old Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan,Vietnam, and Israel with his then 25-year-old brotherBobby(who had just graduated from law school four months earlier) and his then 27-year-old sister Pat. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. This 25,000-mile (40,000&#160;km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends.[271]Bobby wascampaign managerfor Kennedy's successful 1952 Senate campaign and later, his successful 1960 presidential campaign. The two brothers worked closely together from 1957 to 1959 on theSenate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field, when Robert was its chief counsel. During Kennedy's presidency, Robert served in hiscabinetasAttorney Generaland was his closest advisor.[271]Kennedy was a life member of theNational Rifle Association.[272][273]Kennedy came in third (behind Martin Luther King, Jr. andMother Teresa) inGallup's List of Widely Admired Peopleof the 20th century.[274][275]ChildrenCaroline Bouvier Kennedywas born in 1957 and is the only surviving member of JFK's immediate family.John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Jr., nicknamed "John-John" by the press as a child, was born in late November 1960, 17 days after his father was elected. John Jr., died in 1999 when thesmall plane he was piloting crasheden route toMartha's Vineyard.[276]Popular imageThe Kennedy brothers: Attorney GeneralRobert F. Kennedy, SenatorTed Kennedy, and President John F. Kennedy in 1963Kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in themedia culturein ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. AlthoughEisenhowerhad allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcastliveand made good use of the medium.[277]In 1961 theRadio-Television News Directors Associationpresented Kennedy with its highest honor, thePaul WhiteAward, in recognition of his open relationship with the media.[278]Mrs. Kennedy brought new art and furniture to the White House, and directed its restoration. They invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of White House dinners, raising the profile of the arts in America. On the White House lawn, the Kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while Caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home.The president was closely tied to popular culture, emphasized by songs such as "Twistingat the White House".Vaughn Meader'sFirst Familycomedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies. On May 19, 1962,Marilyn Monroesang "Happy Birthday, Mr. President" at a large party inMadison Square Garden, celebrating Kennedy's upcoming forty-fifth birthday."Camelot Era"The term "Camelot" came to be retroactively seen as iconic of the Kennedy administration, and the charisma of him and his family. The term was first publicly used by his wife, in a post-assassinationLifemagazineinterview withTheodore H. White, in which she revealed his affection for the contemporaryBroadway musical of the same name, particularly the closing lines of the title song:[279]Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot."There'll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another Camelot."&mdash;&#160;Jacqueline Kennedy[280]HealthIn 2002Robert Dallekwrote an extensive history of Kennedy's health. Dallek was able to consult a collection of Kennedy-associated papers from the years 1955-1963 including x-rays and prescription records from the files of White House physicianDr. Janet Travell. According to Travell's records, during his Presidential years Kennedy suffered from: high fevers, stomach, colon, and prostate issues, abscesses, high cholesterol, and adrenal problems. Travell kept a "Medicine Administration Record," cataloguing Kennedy's medications: "injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil, Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and Tuinal to help him sleep."[10]Years after Kennedy's death, it was revealed that in September 1947, while Kennedy was 30 and in his first term in Congress, he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis atThe London ClinicwithAddison's disease, a rare endocrine disorder. In 1966 Dr. Travell revealed that Kennedy also hadhypothyroidism. The presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy hadautoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2(APS 2).[281]Kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery and was written up in theAmerican Medical Association'sArchives of Surgery. Kennedy's condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961Vienna Summitwith Soviet PremierNikita Khrushchev. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity,hypertension, impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.[282]Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors, one of whom,Max Jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial[283]and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.[284]There were disagreements among his doctors, into late 1961, over the proper balance of medication and exercise, with the president preferring the former as he was short on time and desired immediate relief.[179]During that timeframe the president's physician, George Burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the White House basement where Kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week.[285]Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy's lifetime.[286]Personal tragediesMain article:Kennedy curseThe Kennedys on their wedding day, surrounded by relativesThe First Family in 1962Kennedy experienced many personal, family tragedies. The oldest Kennedy sibling,Joe Jr., was killed in action over theEnglish Channelin 1944 during World War II at the age of 29. Kennedy's younger sister Rose Marie "Rosemary" Kennedy was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a pre-frontal lobotomy at age 23, leaving her permanently incapacitated. His next youngest sister, Kathleen "Kick" Kennedy Cavendish, died in France as the result of a plane crash in 1948. Jacqueline Kennedy wife suffered amiscarriagein 1955 and astillbirthin 1956. A son,Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, died shortly after birth in August 1963.Extramarital relationshipsAttorney GeneralRobert F. Kennedy,Marilyn Monroe, President Kennedy (back to camera) in 1962.As a young single man in the 1940s, Kennedy had affairs with Danish journalistInga Arvad,[287]and actressGene Tierney.[288]Later in life, Kennedy reportedly had affairs with a number of women, includingMarilyn Monroe,[289]Gunilla von Post,[290]Judith Campbell,[291]Mary Pinchot Meyer,[292]Marlene Dietrich,[293]Mimi Alford,[294]and his wife'spress secretaryPamela Turnure.[295]The extent of a relationship with Monroe will never be known, although it has been reported they spent a weekend together in March 1962 while Kennedy was staying atBing Crosby's house.[296]Furthermore, the White House switchboard noted calls from her during 1962.[297]J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, received reports as to Kennedy's indiscretions.[298]Kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.[299]According to Reeves, this included "the logistics of Kennedy's liaisons.....[which] required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians".[300]Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from revelations about his sex life.[301]AncestryTheKennedy familyoriginally came from Dunganstown,County Wexford,Ireland.[302]In 1848,Patrick Kennedy(1823&ndash;1858) left his farm and boarded a ship inNew Rossbound forLiverpoolon his way toBoston.[303]Kennedy departed at the height of Ireland'sGreat Famine. It was in Boston he met the woman he was to marry, Bridget Murphy (c.1824&ndash;1888).[304]Kennedy's paternal great-grandfather came to Boston and took a job as a migrant worker. He died several years later fromcholera.[305]They had three daughters and two sons (the elder son died young from cholera). He left behind a widow and four children to carry on, the youngest child being Joseph Kennedy, Sr.'s father,Patrick Joseph "P. J." Kennedy.LegacyTelevision became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding John F. Kennedy's assassination. In fact, television started to come of age before the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy helped inaugurate network television's first half hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview withCBS Evening NewsanchorWalter Cronkite.[306]Kennedy on a U.S. postage stamp, issue of 1967Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information. In this sense it was the first major "TV news event" of its kind, the TV coverage uniting the nation, interpreting what went on and creating memories of this space in time. All three major U.S. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from November 22 through November 25, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9/11.[307]Kennedy's state funeral processionand the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald were all broadcast live in America and in other places around the world. Thestate funeralwas the first of three in a span of 12 months. The other two were for GeneralDouglas MacArthurand PresidentHerbert Clark Hoover. All three have two things in common: the commanding general of theMilitary District of Washingtonduring those funerals was Army Major GeneralPhilip C. Wehleand theriderless horsewasBlack Jack, who also served in that role duringLyndon B. Johnson's funeral.The assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the U.S. but around the world. Many vividly remember where they were when first learning of the news that Kennedy was assassinated, as with the Japaneseattack on Pearl Harboron December 7, 1941, before it and the September 11 attacks after it. UN AmbassadorAdlai Stevensonsaid of the assassination: "all of us..... will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours." Many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators and the causes of the killing as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, especially theVietnam War.TheUS Special Forceshad a special bond with Kennedy. "It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret," said Forrest Lindley, a writer for the US military newspaperStars and Stripeswho served with Special Forces in Vietnam.[c]This bond was shown atKennedy's funeral. At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death, GeneralMichael D. Healy, the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam, spoke atArlington Cemetery. Later, a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.Kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the U.S. Navy,[308]and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of anotherspecial forcescommand, theNavy SEALs,[309]which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.[310]Ultimately, the death of President Kennedy and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishment&mdash;a point made by commentators fromGore VidaltoArthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.and implied byOliver Stonein several of his films, such as his landmark 1991JFK.Although President Kennedy opposed segregation and had shown support for the civil rights of African Americans, he originally believed in a more measured approach to legislation given the political realities he faced in Congress, especially with the Southern Conservatives.[311]However, impelled by the civil rights demonstrations ofMartin Luther King, Kennedy in 1963 proposed legislative action. In a radio and TV address to the nation in June 1963&mdash;a century after PresidentAbraham Lincolnhad signed theEmancipation Proclamation&mdash;Kennedy became the first president to call on all Americans to denounce racism as morally wrong. Kennedy's civil rights proposals led to theCivil Rights Act of 1964.[312]PresidentLyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president's memory.[313][314]President Johnson then signed the Act into law on July 2, 1964. This civil rights law ended what was known as the "Solid South" and certain provisions were modeled after theCivil Rights Act of 1875, signed into law by PresidentUlysses S. Grant.[315]Kennedy's continuation of PresidentsHarry S. TrumanandDwight D. Eisenhower's policies of giving economic and military aid toSouth Vietnamleft the door open for President Johnson's escalation of the conflict.[316]At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members and writers to continue to disagree on whether the Vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived.[317][138]His agreement to the NSAM 263[134]action of withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and his earlier 1963 speech atAmerican University,[136]suggested he was ready to end theVietnam War. TheVietnam Warcontributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape.Many of Kennedy's speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office and lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league asAbraham Lincoln,George Washington, andFranklin D. Roosevelt. Some excerpts of Kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington.He was posthumously awarded thePacem in Terris Award. It was named after a 1963encyclicalletter byPope John XXIIIthat calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations.Pacem in terrisisLatinfor 'Peace on Earth'.President Kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father. He is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent. His maternal grandmother, Mary Josephine "Josie" Hannon, died in August 1964, several months after his assassination.Throughout theEnglish-speaking world, the given nameKennedyhas sometimes been used in honor of President Kennedy, as well his brother Robert.[318]EponymsJohn F.

KennedyCoat of armsIn 1961, Kennedy was presented with a grant ofarmsfor all the descendants ofPatrick Kennedyfrom theChief Herald of Ireland. The design of the arms strongly alludes to symbols in the coats of arms of theO'Kennedysof Ormonde and theFitzGeraldsof Desmond, from whom the family is believed to be descended. The crest is an armored hand holding four arrows between two olive branches, elements taken from the coat of arms of the United States of America and also symbolic of Kennedy and his brothers.Kennedy received a signet ring engraved with his arms for his 44th birthday as a gift from his wife, and the arms were incorporated into the seal of the USSJohn F. Kennedy. Following his assassination, Kennedy was honored by the Canadian government by having a mountain,Mount Kennedy, named for him, which his brother, Robert Kennedy, climbed in 1965 to plant a banner of the arms at the summit.[320]MediaKennedy comments on the possible prevention of the Cold WarSorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.President Kennedy comments on the possible prevention of the Cold WarKennedy's message to TurkeySorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.Kennedy's message toTurkishPresidentCemal Gurseland The Turkish People on the Anniversary of the Death ofKemal Ataturk, November 10, 1963 (accompanying text)Announcement to go to the moonSorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.Announcement by John F.

"Although individual leftists had been murdered intermittently over the previous years, the scale on which the killings and arrests took place in the spring and summer of 1963 indicates a closely coordinated campaign, and it is almost certain that those who carried out the raid on suspects' homes were working from lists supplied to them. Precisely how these lists had been compiled is a matter of conjecture, but it is certain that some of the Ba'athist leaders were in touch with American intelligence networks, and it is also undeniable that a variety of different groups in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East had a strong vested interest in breaking what was probably the strongest and most popular Communist Party in the region."^Reich, Bernard.Political Leaders of the Contemporary Middle East and North Africa: A Biographical Dictionary, Greenwood Press, 1990. p. 241.ISBN 0313262136.^Frontline."James Chritchfield Interview."1995.PBS.^"President John F.
