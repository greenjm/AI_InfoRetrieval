He was also the first president to die in office. He was 68 years, 23 days old when inaugurated, the oldest president to take office untilRonald Reaganin 1981. Harrison died on his 32nd day in office[a]of complications frompneumonia, serving the shortest tenure in United States presidential history. His death sparked a briefconstitutional crisis, but its resolution left unsettled many questions following the presidential line of succession in regards to constitution up until the passage of the25th Amendmentin 1967. He was thegrandfatherofBenjamin Harrison, who was the 23rd President from 1889 to 1893.Before election as president, Harrison served as the firstterritorial congressional delegatefrom theNorthwest Territory,governorof theIndiana Territory, and later as aU.S. representativeandsenatorfromOhio. He originally gained national fame for leading U.S. forces againstAmerican Indiansat theBattle of Tippecanoein 1811,[1]where he earned thenickname"Tippecanoe" (or "Old Tippecanoe"). As ageneralin the subsequentWar of 1812, his most notable action was in theBattle of the Thamesin 1813, which brought an end to hostilities in his region. This battle resulted in the death ofTecumsehand the dissolution of the Indian coalition which he led.[2]After the war, Harrison moved to Ohio, where he was elected to theUnited States House of Representatives. In 1824, the state legislature elected him to theU.S. Senate. He served a truncated term after being appointed asMinister PlenipotentiarytoColombiain May 1828. In Colombia, he spoke withSimón Bolívar, urging his nation to adopt American-style democracy.Returning to his farm in Ohio, Harrison lived in relative retirement until he was nominated for the presidency in 1836. Defeated, he retired again to his farm. He was elected president in 1840, and died ofpneumoniain April 1841, a month after taking office.Contents1Early life1.1Early life and education1.2Early military career1.3Marriage and family2Political career2.1As Member of Congress2.2As Governor3Army general3.1Tecumseh and Tippecanoe3.2War of 18124Postwar life4.1Public office4.2Private citizen4.31836 presidential campaign4.41840 presidential campaign5Presidency (1841)5.1Shortest presidency5.2Administration and cabinet6Death and funeral6.1Impact of death6.2Legacy7See also8Notes8.1Explanatory notes8.2Citations9Further reading10External linksEarly life[edit]Early life and education[edit]William Henry Harrison was born February 9, 1773, the youngest ofBenjamin Harrison Vand Elizabeth Bassett's seven children. They werea prominent political familywho lived onBerkeley PlantationinCharles City County, Virginia, where he was born.[3]He was the last president born as a British subject beforeAmerican Independence. His father was a planter and a delegate to theContinental Congress(1774&ndash;1777), who signed theDeclaration of Independence. The senior Harrison wasgovernor of Virginiabetween 1781 and 1784, during and after theAmerican Revolutionary War.[4]William's older brother,Carter Bassett Harrison, was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Virginia.[3]In 1787, at the age of 14, Harrison entered thePresbyterianHampden&ndash;Sydney College.[5]He attended the school until 1790, becoming well-versed in Latin and basic French. He was removed by hisEpiscopalianfather, possibly because of a religious revival occurring at the school. He briefly attended a boys' academy inSouthampton County. He allegedly was influenced by antislaveryQuakersandMethodistsat the school.Angered, his proslavery father had him transfer toPhiladelphiafor medical training, where Harrison boarded withRobert Morris. The young Harrison entered theUniversity of Pennsylvaniain 1790, where he studied medicine under Dr.Benjamin Rush.[6]As Harrison later told his biographer, he did not enjoy the subject. Shortly after Harrison started these studies, his father died in 1791, leaving him without funds for further schooling. Eighteen years old, Harrison was left in the guardianship of Morris.[7]Early military career[edit]Governor Henry Leeof Virginia, a friend of Harrison's father, learned of Harrison's situation after his father's death and persuaded him to join the army. Within 24&#160;hours of meeting Lee, Harrison was commissioned as anensignin theU.S. Army,1st Infantry Regimentat the age of 18. He was first assigned toCincinnatiin theNorthwest Territory, where the army was engaged in the ongoingNorthwest Indian War.[8]General"Mad Anthony" Waynetook command of the western army in 1792 following a disastrous defeat under its previous commander,Arthur St. Clair. Harrison was promoted to lieutenant that summer because of his strict attention to discipline, and the following year, he was promoted to serve asaide-de-camp. From Wayne, Harrison learned how to successfully command an army on theAmerican frontier. Harrison participated in Wayne's decisive victory at theBattle of Fallen Timbersin 1794, which brought theNorthwest Indian Warto a successful close for the United States.[9]After the war, Lieutenant Harrison was one of the signatories of theTreaty of Greenvillein 1795, which forced cession of lands by Native Americans and opened much of present-day Ohio to settlement by European Americans.[3][10][11]After the death of his mother in 1793, Harrison inherited a portion of the family's estate, including about 3,000 acres (12&#160;km2) of land and several slaves. Still in the army at the time, Harrison sold his land to his brother.[12]Marriage and family[edit]In 1795 at the age of 22, Harrison metAnna Tuthill Symmes, ofNorth Bend, Ohio. She was a daughter of Anna Tuthill and JudgeJohn Cleves Symmes, a prominent figure in the state and former representative to theCongress of the Confederation.[3]When Harrison asked the judge for permission to marry Anna, he was refused. The pair waited until Symmes left on business, then theyelopedand married on November 25, 1795.[13]They married at the North Bend home of Dr. Stephen Wood, Treasurer of the Northwest Territory. The couple honeymooned atFort Washington, as Harrison was still on duty. Two weeks later, at a farewell dinner for General Wayne, Symmes confronted his new son-in-law for the first time since the wedding, sternly demanding to know how Harrison intended to support a family. Harrison responded, "by my sword, and my own right arm, sir."[14]Afterward, still concerned about Harrison's ability to provide for Anna, Symmes sold the young couple 160 acres (65&#160;ha) of land in North Bend.[15]Symmes did not come to accept Harrison until he had achieved fame on the battlefield .Together, the Harrisons had 10 children. Nine lived into adulthood and one died in infancy. Anna was frequently in poor health during the marriage, primarily due to her many pregnancies. She nonetheless outlived William by 23 years, dying at age 88 on February 25, 1864.[16]In a biography ofWalter Francis White, the noted African American civil rights leader and president of theNAACPin the mid-20th century, historian Kenneth Robert Janken notes that White's mother Madeline Harrison traced some of her mixed-race white ancestry to Harrison in Virginia. Her family holds that Dilsia, a femaleslavebelonging to William Henry Harrison, had six children by him, born into slavery. Four were said to be sold to a planter inLa Grange, Georgia, including a daughter, Marie Harrison. Marie was Madeline's mother.[17]Political career[edit]Harrison resigned from the army in 1798[18]and began campaigning among his friends and family for a post in the Northwest Territorial government. With the aid of his close friend,Secretary of StateTimothy Pickering, he was recommended to replace the outgoing Secretary of the Territory. Harrison was appointed to the position, and frequentlyacted as governorduring the absences of GovernorArthur St. Clair.[19]As Member of Congress[edit]Harrison had many friends in the elite eastern social circles, and quickly gained a reputation among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. He championed for lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. TheU.S. Congresshad legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, a policy disliked by many of the territory's residents. When Harrison ran for Congress, he campaigned to work to alter the situation to encourage migration to the territory.[20]In 1799, at age 26, Harrison defeated the son of Arthur St. Clair and was elected as the firstdelegaterepresenting the Northwest Territory in theSixth United States Congress. He served from March 4, 1799, to May 14, 1800.[3][21]As a delegate from a territory, not a state, he had no authority to vote on bills, but was permitted to serve on a committee, submit legislation, and debate.[22]Asdelegate, Harrison successfully promoted the passage of theHarrison Land Act. This made it easier for the average settler to buy land in the Northwest Territory by allowing land to be sold in smalltracts. The availability of inexpensive land was an important factor in the rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory.[23]Harrison also served on the committee that decided how to divide the Northwest Territory. The committee recommended splitting the territory into two segments, creating the Ohio Territory and theIndiana Territory. The bill, 2&#160;Stat.&#160;58, passed and the two new territories were established in 1800.[24]Without informing Harrison,PresidentJohn Adamsnominated him to become governor of the new territory, based on his ties to "the west" and seemingly neutral political stances. Harrison was confirmed by the Senate the following day.[25]Caught unaware, Harrison accepted the position only after receiving assurances from theJeffersoniansthat he would not be removed from office after they gained power in the upcoming elections.[26]He then resigned from Congress.[27]The Indiana Territory consisted of the future states ofIndiana,Illinois,Michigan,Wisconsin, and the eastern portion ofMinnesota.[28]As Governor[edit]See also:History of slavery in IndianaandIndiana TerritoryHarrison moved toVincennes, the capital of the newly establishedIndiana Territory, on January 10, 1801.[27]While in Vincennes, Harrison built a plantation-style home he namedGrouselandfor its many birds. It was one of the first brick structures in the territory. The home, which has been restored and has become a popular modern tourist attraction, served as the center of social and political life in the territory.[16]He also built a second home nearCorydon, the second capital, atHarrison Valley.[29]As governor, Harrison had wide-ranging powers in the new territory, including the authority to appoint all territorial officials, and the territorial legislature, and to control the division of the territory into political districts. A primary responsibility was to obtain title toIndianlands. This would allow European-American settlement to expand and increase U.S. population to enable the region to gain statehood.[3]Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well, as his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's rise to statehood. In 1803, PresidentThomas Jeffersongranted Harrison authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.Harrison supervised the development of 13 treaties, through which the territory bought more than 60,000,000 acres (240,000&#160;km2) of land from Indian leaders, including much of present-day southernIndiana. The 1804 Treaty of St. Louis withQuashquameled to the surrender by theSaukandMeskwakiof much of western Illinois and parts ofMissouri. This treaty and loss of lands were greatly resented by many of the Sauk, especiallyBlack Hawk. It was the primary reason the Sauk sided with the United Kingdom during theWar of 1812. Harrison thought theTreaty of Grouselandin 1805 appeased some of the issues for Indians, but tensions remained high on the frontier.The 1809Treaty of Fort Wayneraised new tensions. Harrison purchased from theMiami tribe, who claimed ownership of the land, more than 2,500,000&#160;acres (10,000&#160;km˛) of land inhabited byShawnee,Kickapoo,Wea, andPiankeshawpeoples. Harrison rushed the process by offering large subsidies to the tribes and their leaders so that he could have the treaty in place before President Jefferson left office and the administration changed.[29][30]The tribes living on the lands were furious and sought to have the treaty overturned, but were unsuccessful.In 1803, HarrisonlobbiedCongress to repeal Article 6 of theNorthwest Ordinance, to permitslaveryin the Indiana Territory. He claimed it was necessary to make the region more appealing to settlers and would make the territory economically viable.[31]Congress suspended the article for 10 years, during which time the territories covered by the ordinance were granted the right to decide for themselves whether to permit slavery. That year, Harrison had the appointed territorial legislature authorizeindenturing.[32]He attempted to have slavery legalized outright, in both 1805 and 1807. This caused a significant stir in the territory. When in 1809 the legislature was popularly elected for the first time, Harrison found himself at odds with them as theabolitionistparty came to power. They immediately blocked his plans for slavery and repealed the indenturing laws he had passed in 1803.[33]President Jefferson, the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, had made a secret compact withJames Lemento defeat the proslavery movement led by Harrison. Although a slaveholder, he did not want slavery to expand into the Northwest Territory, as he believed the institution should end. Under the "Jefferson-Lemen compact", Jefferson donated money to Lemen to found churches in Illinois and Indiana to stop the proslavery movement. InIndiana, the founding of an antislavery church led to citizens' signing a petition and organizing politically to defeat Harrison's efforts to legalize slavery. Jefferson and Lemen were both instrumental in defeating Harrison's attempts in 1805 and 1807 to secure approval of slavery in the territory.[34]Army general[edit]Tecumseh and Tippecanoe[edit]Main articles:Tecumseh's WarandBattle of TippecanoeAn Indian resistance movement against U.S. expansion had been growing through the leadership of the Shawnee brothers,TecumsehandTenskwatawa(The Prophet). The conflict became known asTecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by theGreat Spiritand no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.[35]In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 armed warriors down theWabash Riverto meet with Harrison in Vincennes. As the warriors were dressed in war paint, their sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate. He argued that no one tribe could sell land without the approval of the other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms, and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly.[36]Harrison said the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation. He said each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one nation.[37]Tecumseh launched an "impassioned rebuttal", but Harrison was unable to understand his language.[37]A Shawnee friendly to Harrison cocked his pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh's speech was leading to trouble. Some witnesses reported that Tecumseh was encouraging the warriors to kill Harrison. Many of the warriors began to pull their weapons, representing a substantial threat to Harrison and the town, which held a population of only 1,000. Harrison pulled his sword. Tecumseh's warriors backed down after the officers had pulled their firearms in defense of Harrison.[37]Chief Winnemac, who was friendly to Harrison, countered Tecumseh's arguments and told the warriors that since they had come in peace, they should return home in peace. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the treaty were nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British.[38]After the meeting, Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create aconfederationto battle the United States.[39]A depiction of Tecumseh in 1848In 1811, while Tecumseh was traveling, Harrison was authorized bySecretary of WarWilliam Eustisto march against the nascent confederation as a show of force. Harrison led an army of more than 1,000 men north to try to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace. Instead, the tribes launched a surprise attack on Harrison's army early on the morning of November 6, in what became known as theBattle of Tippecanoe. Harrison defeated the tribal forces atProphetstown, next to the Wabash andTippecanoe Rivers. Harrison was hailed as a national hero and the battle became famous. However, his troops had greatly outnumbered the attackers, and suffered many more casualties during the battle.[40]When reporting to Secretary Eustis, Harrison informed him the battle occurred near the Tippecanoe River (which led to its naming), and he feared an imminent reprisal attack. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary at first interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the US victory clear. When no second attack came, the defeat of the Shawnee was more certain. Eustis demanded to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against attacks. Harrison countered by saying he had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and theDepartment of Warthat continued into the War of 1812.[41]The press did not cover the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's dispatch to Eustis to mean he was defeated.[42]By December, as most major American papers carried stories on the battle, public outrage over the Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with theUnited Kingdom, many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. A few months later, the U.S. declared war against UK.[43]War of 1812[edit]Thisportraitof Harrison originally showed him incivilianclothes as thecongressional delegatefrom theNorthwest Territoryin 1800, but the uniform was added after he became famous in the War of 1812.The outbreak of war with the British in 1812 led to continued conflict with Indians in the Old Northwest, and Harrison was kept in command of the army in Indiana. After the loss ofDetroit, GeneralJames Winchesterbecame the commander of theArmy of the Northwest. He offered Harrison the rank ofbrigadier general, which he refused, as he wanted sole command of the army. PresidentJames Madisonremoved Winchester and made Harrison the commander on September 17, 1812. Harrison inherited an army of fresh recruits, which he endeavored to drill. Initially, he was greatly outnumbered by the British with their Indian allies. In the winter of 1812&ndash;13, Harrison constructed a defensive position at the rapids on theMaumee Riverin northwest Ohio. He named itFort Meigsin honor of the Ohio governor,Return J. Meigs, Jr.After receiving reinforcements in 1813, Harrison took the offensive. He led the army north to battle the Shawnee and their new British allies. He won victories in Indiana and Ohio, and recaptured Detroit, before invading Canada. He defeated the British at theBattle of the Thames, in which Tecumseh was killed.[44]The Battle of the Thames was considered one of the great American victories in the war, second only to theBattle of New Orleans.[44][45]Secretary of WarJohn Armstrongdivided the command of the army, assigning Harrison to a "backwater" post and giving control of the front to one of Harrison's subordinates. Armstrong and Harrison had disagreed over the lack of coordination and effectiveness in the invasion of Canada. When Harrison was reassigned, he promptly resigned from the army. His resignation was accepted in the summer of 1814.[45]After the war ended, Congress investigated Harrison's resignation. It determined that he had been mistreated by the Secretary of War during his campaign and that his resignation was justified. They awarded Harrison a gold medal for his services during the War of 1812.Postwar life[edit]Public office[edit]Harrison returned to North Bend after he was replaced as Governor of Indiana Territory, and he returned his farm to cultivation and enlarged the log cabin farmhouse.[46]In 1814, he was appointed by President Madison to serve as a commissioner to negotiate two treaties with the Indian tribes in the Northwest. Both treaties were advantageous to the United States, as the tribes ceded a large tract of land in the west. It provided more land for American purchase and settlement.[21]Harrison was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to finish the term ofJohn McLeanof Ohio, serving from October 8, 1816, to March 4, 1819. He was elected to and served in theOhio State Senatefrom 1819 to 1821, having lost the election forOhio governorin 1820. In 1822, he ran for the U.S. House, but lost by only 500 votes toJames W. Gazlay. In 1824, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served until May 20, 1828. Fellow westerners in Congress called Harrison a "Buckeye", a term of affection related to the nativeOhio buckeyetree.[21]He was an Ohiopresidential electorin 1820 forJames Monroe.[47]and an Ohio presidential elector in 1824 forHenry Clay.[48]In 1817, Harrison declined to serve as Secretary of War under President Monroe.Appointed asminister plenipotentiarytoGran Colombia, Harrison resigned from Congress and served in his new post until March 8, 1829.[21]He arrived inBogotáon December 22, 1828. He found the condition of Colombia saddening. Harrison reported to the Secretary of State that the country was on the edge of anarchy and he thoughtSimón Bolívarwas about to become a military dictator. While minister in Colombia, Harrison wrote a rebuke to Bolívar, stating "...&#160;the strongest of all governments is that which is most free". He called on Bolívar to encourage the development of a democracy. In response, Bolívar wrote, "The United States&#160;... seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom", a sentiment that achieved fame in Latin America.[49]When the new administration of PresidentAndrew Jacksontook office in March 1829, Harrison was recalled so the new president could make his own appointment to the position. He returned to the United States in June.[50]Private citizen[edit]Harrison in a copy of an 1835White Houseportrait byJames Reid LambdinAfter Harrison returned to the United States in 1829, he settled on his farm inNorth Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state. There, he lived in relative retirement after nearly 40&#160;years of continuous government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to theHamilton CountyAgricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.[51]In these early years, Harrison also earned money from his contributions to a biography written by James Hall, entitledA Memoir of the Public Services of William Henry Harrison, published in 1836. That year, he made an unsuccessful run for the presidency as aWhigcandidate. Between 1836 and 1840, Harrison served asClerk of CourtsforHamilton County. This was his job when he was elected president in 1840.[52]By 1840, when Harrison campaigned for president a second time, more than 12 books had been published on his life. He was hailed by many as a national hero.[53]1836 presidential campaign[edit]Main article:United States presidential election, 1836Chromolithographcampaign poster for William Henry HarrisonHarrison was the Northern Whig candidate for president in 1836, one of only two times in American history when a major political party intentionally ran more than one presidential candidate (the Democrats ran two candidates in 1860). Vice PresidentMartin Van Buren, the Democratic candidate, was popular and deemed likely to win the election against an individual Whig candidate. The Whig plan was to elect popular Whigs regionally, deny Van Buren the 148 electoral votes needed for election, and force the House of Representatives to decide the election. They hoped the Whigs would control the House after the general elections. (This strategy would have failed, as the Democrats retained a majority in the House following the election.)[54][55]Harrison ran in all the free states except Massachusetts, and the slave states of Delaware, Maryland, and Kentucky.Hugh L. Whiteran in the remaining slave states except for South Carolina.Daniel Websterran in Massachusetts, andWillie P. Mangumin South Carolina.[56]The plan narrowly failed, as Van Buren won the election with 170 electoral votes. A swing of just over 4,000 votes in Pennsylvania would have given that state's 30 electoral votes to Harrison, and the election would have been decided in the House of Representatives.[54][55][57]1840 presidential campaign[edit]Main article:United States presidential election, 1840Poster of Harrison's accomplishmentsHarrison was the Whig candidate (and again faced Van Buren, now the incumbent president) in the1840 election. The Whig party unified behind a single candidate, and Harrison was chosen over more controversial members of the party, such as Clay and Webster. Harrison based his campaign on his military record and on the weak U.S. economy, caused by thePanic of 1837. In a ploy to blame Van Buren for the depressed economy, the Whigs nicknamed him "Van Ruin".[58]The Democrats ridiculed Harrison by calling him "Granny Harrison, the petticoat general", because he resigned from the army before the War of 1812 ended. When asking voters whether Harrison should be elected, they asked them what his name backwards was, which happens to be "No Sirrah". Democrats cast Harrison as a provincial, out-of-touch old man who would rather "sit in his log cabin drinking hard cider" than attend to the administration of the country. This strategy backfired when Harrison and his vice presidential running mate,John Tyler, adopted the log cabin and hard cider as campaign symbols. They used the images in banners and posters, and created bottles of hard cider that were shaped like log cabins, all to connect to the "common man".[59]Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each countyAlthough Harrison had come from a wealthy, slaveholding Virginia family, in this campaign he was promoted as a humble frontiersman in the style of the popular Andrew Jackson. A memorable example was theGold Spoon Oration, delivered by a Whig representative. Van Buren, by contrast, was presented as a wealthy elitist.[60]A Whig chant from the time of the election exhibited the difference between candidates:Old Tip he wore a homespun coat, he had no ruffled shirt: wirt-wirt,But Matt he has the golden plate, and he's a little squirt: wirt-wirt!People singing the chant would spit tobacco juice while singing "wirt-wirt".[61]The Whigs boasted of Harrison's military record and reputation as the hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe. Their campaign slogan, "Tippecanoe and Tyler, too", became among the most famous in American politics.[61]On election day, Harrison won a landslide electoral college victory, though the popular vote was much closer, at 53% to 47%.[61]Presidency (1841)[edit]Shortest presidency[edit]William Henry Harrison (Bass Otis, 1841)When Harrison came to Washington, he wanted to show both that he was still the steadfast hero of Tippecanoe, and that he was a more learned and thoughtful man than the backwoods caricature ascribed to him in the campaign. Hetook the oath of officeon March 4, 1841, a cold and wet day.[62]He wore neither an overcoat nor hat, rode on horseback to the ceremony rather than in the closed carriage that had been offered him, and delivered the longestinaugural addressin American history.[62]At 8,445 words, it took him nearly two hours to read, although his friend and fellow WhigDaniel Websterhad edited it for length. Harrison then rode through the streets in the inaugural parade,[63]and that evening attended three inaugural balls,[64]including one at Carusi's Saloon entitled the "Tippecanoe" ball, which at a price of US$10 per person (equal to $229 today) attracted 1000 guests.The inaugural address was a detailed statement of the Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish theBank of the United Statesand extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay'sAmerican system); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson'sspoils systemof executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.[65][66]As leader of the Whigs and a powerful legislator (as well as a frustrated presidential candidate in his own right), Clay expected to have substantial influence in the Harrison administration. He ignored his own platform plank of overturning the "spoils" system. Clay attempted to influence Harrison's actions before and during his brief presidency, especially in putting forth his own preferences for Cabinet offices and other presidential appointments. Harrison rebuffed his aggression, saying "Mr. Clay, you forget thatIam the President."[67]The dispute intensified when Harrison namedDaniel Webster, Clay's arch-rival, for control of the Whig Party, as his Secretary of State, and appeared to give Webster's supporters some highly coveted patronage positions. Harrison's sole concession to Clay was to name his protégéJohn J. Crittendento the post ofAttorney General. Despite this, the dispute continued until the President's death.Clay was not the only one who hoped to benefit from Harrison's election. Hordes of office applicants came to theWhite House, which was then open to all comers who wanted a meeting with the President. Most of Harrison's business during his month-long presidency involved extensive social obligations&mdash;an inevitable part of his high position and arrival in Washington&mdash;and receiving visitors at the White House. They awaited him at all hours and filled the Executive Mansion.[63]Harrison wrote in a letter dated March 10, "I am so much harassed by the multitude that call upon me that I can give no proper attention to any business of my own."[68]Nevertheless, Harrison sent a number of nominations for office to the Senate for confirmation during his month in office. The new27th Congresshad convened an extraordinary session for the purpose of confirming Harrison's cabinet and other important nominees; since a number of them arrived after Congress' March 15 adjournment, however, John Tyler would ultimately be forced to renominate many of Harrison's selections.File:HARRISON, William H-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpgBEPengraved portrait of Harrison as President.Harrison took his pledge to reform executive appointments very seriously, visiting each of the six executive departments to observe its operations and issuing through Webster an order to all departments thatelectioneeringby employees would henceforth be considered grounds for dismissal.[69]As he had with Clay, Harrison resisted pressure from other Whigs over partisan patronage. When a group arrived in his office on March 16 to demand the removal of all Democrats from any appointed office, Harrison proclaimed, "So help me God, I will resign my office before I can be guilty of such an iniquity!"[70]Harrison's own cabinet attempted to countermand the president's appointment ofJohn ChambersasGovernor of Iowain favor of Webster's friend, GeneralJames Wilson; when Webster attempted to press this decision at a March 25 cabinet meeting, however, Harrison asked him to read aloud a handwritten note (which said simply "William Henry Harrison, President of the United States"), then announced that "William Henry Harrison, President of the United States, tells you, gentlemen, that, by God, John Chambers shall be governor of Iowa!"[71]Harrison's only official act of consequence was to call Congress into a special session. Henry Clay and he had disagreed over the necessity of such a session, and when on March 11 Harrison's cabinet proved evenly divided, the president vetoed the idea. When Clay pressed Harrison on the special session on March 13, the president rebuffed his counsel and told him not to visit the White House again, but to address him only in writing.[72]A few days later, however, Treasury SecretaryThomas Ewingreported to Harrison that federal funds were in such trouble that the government could not continue to operate until Congress' regularly scheduled session in December; Harrison thus relented, and on March 17 proclaimed the special session in the interests of "the condition of the revenue and finance of the country". The session was scheduled to begin on May 31.[73][74]Administration and cabinet[edit]The Harrison CabinetOfficeNameTermPresidentWilliam Henry Harrison1841Vice PresidentJohn Tyler1841Secretary of StateDaniel Webster1841Secretary of TreasuryThomas Ewing1841Secretary of WarJohn Bell1841Attorney GeneralJohn J.

Badger1841Harrison'sPresidential $1 coinWilliam Henry Harrison,issue of 1938Death and funeral[edit]Death of Harrison, April 4, 1841On March 26, Harrison became ill with acold. According to the prevailing medical misconception of that time, his illness was believed to be directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event.[75]The cold worsened, rapidly turning topneumoniaandpleurisy.[75]He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce.[63]Harrison's doctors tried cures, applyingopium,castor oil,leeches, andVirginia snakeweed, but the treatments only made Harrison worse, and he became delirious. He died nine days after becoming ill,[76]at 12:30&#160;am on April 4, 1841. Harrison's doctor, Thomas Miller, diagnosed Harrison'scause of deathas "pneumonia of the lower lobe of the right lung", but a 2014 medical analysis concluded that he instead died ofenteric fever. The authors base their findings on the president's symptoms and the close proximity of the White House to a dumping ground for sewage and human waste.[77][78]He was the first United States president to die in office. His last words were to his doctor, but assumed to be directed at John Tyler, "Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more." Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: March 4&#160;&ndash; April 4, 1841, 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.[79][80]Harrison's funeral took place in theWesley Chapelin Cincinnati, Ohio, on April 7, 1841.[81]His original interment was in the public vault of theCongressional Cemeteryin Washington, D.C. He was later buried inNorth Bend, Ohio. TheWilliam Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorialwas erected in his honor.[82]Impact of death[edit]Statue of Harrisonon horsebackinCincinnati, OhioThe William Henry Harrison Memorial in North Bend, OhioHarrison's death was a disappointment toWhigs, who hoped to pass a revenue tariff and enact measures to support Henry Clay's American system.John Tyler, Harrison's successor and a former Democrat, abandoned the Whig agenda, effectively cutting himself off from the party.[83]Due to the death of Harrison, three Presidents served within a single calendar year (Martin Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler). This has happened on only one other occasion, 40 years later in 1881, whenRutherford B. Hayeswas succeeded byJames A. Garfield, who was assassinated later in that year. With the death of Garfield,Chester A. Arthurstepped into the presidency.[84]Harrison's death revealed the flaws in the constitution's clauses on presidential succession.[85]Article II of the Constitutionstates, "In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President&#160;... and [the Vice President] shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected". Scholars at the time disagreed whether the vice president would become president or merely acting President. The Constitution did not stipulate whether the Vice President could serve the remainder of the President's term, until the next election, or if emergency elections should be held.Harrison's cabinet insisted that Tyler was "Vice President acting as President". After the cabinet consulted with theChief JusticeRoger Taney, they decided that if Tyler took the presidentialOath of Office, he would assume the office of President. Tyler obliged and was sworn in on April 6. In May, Congress convened. After a short period of debate in both houses, it passed a resolution that confirmed Tyler in the presidency for the remainder of Harrison's term. Once established, this precedent of presidential succession remained in effect until theTwenty-fifth Amendmentwas ratified in 1967.[83][86]Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the succession of Lyndon B. Johnson to the presidency in 1963, the Twenty-fifth Amendment dealt with the finer points of succession. It defined in what situations the Vice President was acting President, and in what situation the Vice President could become President.Legacy[edit]Statue of Harrison at theSoldiers' and Sailors' Monumentin IndianapolisHarrison (on left) atTippecanoe County Courthouse, Lafayette, IndianaHarrison was the first sitting President to have his photograph taken, on Inauguration Day in 1841. Photographs exist ofJohn Quincy Adams,Andrew Jackson, andMartin van Buren, but those images were all taken after these men had ceased to be President. The Harrison image was also the first of these photographs to be taken. The originaldaguerreotype, made in Washington on his Inauguration Day, has been lost&mdash;although at least one early photographic copy exists in the archives of theMetropolitan Museum of Art.[87]Harrison's chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which laid the foundation for the modern presidential campaign tactics.[88]Harrison died nearly penniless. Congress voted to give his wife a Presidentialwidow's pension, a payment of $25,000,[89]one year of Harrison's salary. This is equivalent to $571,532 today. She also received the right to mail letters free of charge.[90]Harrison's sonJohn Scott Harrisonserved in the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio between 1853 and 1857.[91]Harrison's grandson,Benjamin Harrisonof Indiana, was the 23rd president, from 1889 to 1893, making them the only grandparent&ndash;grandchild pair of Presidents.[92]Numerous places were named after Harrison:Harrison, MichiganHarrison, New JerseyHarrison, OhioHarrison, TennesseeHarrison County, IndianaHarrison County, MississippiHarrison County, IowaHarrison County, OhioThree schools were named William Henry Harrison High School (inEvansvilleandWest Lafayette,IndianaandHarrison, Ohio) in his honor.[93][94][95]During theAmerican Civil War, theUnion Armynamed a post near CincinnatiCamp Harrison.,[96]and a military fort inMontanawas named for him.[97]Because of his short service, no military vessel was named after him as President.A statue of Harrison was erected onMonument CircleinIndianapolis. Additionally, Harrison is shown (on the left, facing the building) in apedimenton theTippecanoe County Courthouse,Lafayette, Indiana, 1882.See also[edit]Book: Presidents of the United States (1789&ndash;1860)Curse of TippecanoeList of Governors of IndianaList of Presidents of the United StatesList of Presidents of the United States by previous experienceU.S. presidents on U.S. postage stampsBiography portalGovernment of the United States portalOhio portalIndiana portalPolitics portalNotes[edit]Explanatory notes[edit]^Harrison served as President for 30 days, 12 hours and 32 minutes, but this was spread over 32 different calendar days; part of a day upon inauguration, 30 full days, then part of the day on which he died.Citations[edit]^Buescher, John."Tippecanoe and Walking Canes Too".
