He was born near the end of thecolonial era, somewhere near the then-unmarked border betweenNorthandSouth Carolina, into a recently immigratedScots-Irishfarming family of relatively modest means. During theAmerican Revolutionary WarJackson, whose family supported the revolutionary cause, acted as a courier. He was captured, at age 13, and mistreated by his British captors. He later became a lawyer. He was elected to theU.S. House of Representatives, and then to theU.S. Senate. In 1801, Jackson was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia, which became his political as well as military base. Jackson owned hundreds of slaves who worked on theHermitage plantationwhich he acquired in 1804. Jackson killed a man in a duel in 1806, over a matter of honor regarding his wifeRachel. Jackson gained national fame through his role in theWar of 1812, most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at theBattle of New Orleans. Jackson's army was then sent to Florida where he deposed the small Spanish garrison. This led directly tothe treatywhich formally transferred Florida from Spain to the United States.Nominated for president in 1824, Jackson narrowly lost toJohn Quincy Adams. Jackson's supporters then founded what became theDemocratic Party.Nominated again in 1828, Jackson crusaded against Adams and the "corrupt bargain" between Adams and Henry Clay he said cost him the 1824 election. Building on his base in the West and new support from Virginia and New York, he won by a landslide. The Adams campaigners called him and his wifeRachel Jackson"bigamists"; she died just after the election and he called the slanderers "murderers," swearing never to forgive them. His struggles with Congress were personified in his personal rivalry withHenry Clay, whom Jackson deeply disliked, and who led the opposition (the emergingWhig Party). As president, he faced a threat of secession fromSouth Carolinaover the "Tariff of Abominations" which Congress had enacted under Adams. In contrast to several of his immediate successors, he denied the right of a state to secede from the union, or to nullify federal law. TheNullification Crisiswas defused when the tariff was amended and Jacksonthreatenedthe use of military force if South Carolina (or any other state) attempted to secede.Congress attempted to reauthorize theSecond Bank of the United Statesseveral years before the expiration of its charter, which he opposed. He vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832, and dismantled it by the time its charter expired in 1836. Jackson's presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the "spoils system" in American politics. Also, he supported, signed, and enforced theIndian Removal Act, which relocated a number of native tribes toIndian Territory(nowOklahoma). He faced and defeated Henry Clay in the1832 Presidential Election, and opposed Clay generally. Jackson supported his vice presidentMartin Van Buren, who was elected president in 1836. He worked to bolster the Democratic Party and helped his friendJames K. Polkwin the 1844 presidential election.Contents1Early life and education2Revolutionary War service3Legal and political career3.1Land speculation and founding of Memphis4Hermitage plantation5Military career5.1War of 18125.1.1Creek campaign and treaty5.1.2Battle of New Orleans5.1.3Enforced martial law New Orleans5.2First Seminole War6Election of 18247Election of 18288Presidency 1829&ndash;18378.1Inauguration8.2Petticoat politics8.3Indian removal policy8.3.1Treaties8.3.2Wars8.4Initiated reforms8.5Rotation in office and spoils system8.6Nullification crisis8.7Foreign affairs8.8Bank veto and Election of 18328.9Removal of deposits and censure8.10Attack and assassination attempt8.11Slavery controversies8.11.1Anti-slavery tracts8.11.2Anti-slavery Congressional petitions8.11.3Recognition of Republic of Texas8.12U.S. Exploring Expedition8.13Panic of 18378.14Administration and cabinet8.15Judicial appointments8.16States admitted to the Union9Later life and death10Family and personal life10.1Temperament10.2Physical appearance10.3Religious faith11Legacy and memory11.1Jackson on U.S. postage11.2Memorials11.3Popular culture depictions12See also13Notes14References14.1Biographies14.2Historiography14.3Specialized studies15External linksEarly life and educationJackson was born on March 15, 1767. His parents wereScots-Irishcolonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson,Presbyterianswho had emigrated fromIrelandtwo years earlier.[1][2]Jackson's father was born inCarrickfergus,County Antrim, in current-dayNorthern Ireland, around 1738.[3]Jackson's parents lived in the village ofBoneybefore, also in County Antrim.When they emigrated to America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in theWaxhawsregion, straddling the border betweenNorthandSouth Carolina.[4]They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764).Jackson's father died in an accident in February 1767, at the age of 29, three weeks before his son Andrew was born in theWaxhawsarea. His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying Jackson's father. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed.[5]In 1824, Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation inLancaster County, South Carolina. But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of theTariff of 1824, which Jackson opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.[5]Jackson received a sporadic education in the local "old-field" school.[6]In 1781, he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop.[7]Later, he taught school and studied law inSalisbury, North Carolina. In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved toJonesborough, in what was then theWestern Districtof North Carolina. This area later became theSouthwest Territory(1790), the precursor to the state of Tennessee.Revolutionary War serviceYoung Jackson Refusing to Clean Major Coffin's Boots(1876lithograph).During theRevolutionary War, Jackson, at age thirteen, informally helped the local militia as a courier.[8]His eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion during theBattle of Stono Ferry, on June 20, 1779. Jackson and his brother Robert were captured by the British and held as prisoners; they nearly starved to death in captivity. When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving Jackson with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British.[9]While imprisoned, the brothers contractedsmallpox.Robert Jackson died on April 27, 1781, a few days after their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers' release. After being assured Andrew would recover, Elizabeth Jackson volunteered to nurseprisoners of waron board two ships inCharlestonharbor, where there had been an outbreak ofcholera. She died from the disease in November 1781, and was buried in an unmarked grave. Jackson became an orphan at age 14.[10]Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war, Jackson blamed the British for his losses.Legal and political careerJackson began his legal career in Jonesborough, now northeastern Tennessee. Though hislegal educationwas scanty, he knew enough to be acountry lawyeron thefrontier. Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law. Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or fromassaultandbattery. In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor (prosecutor) of the Western District and held the same position in the government of theTerritory South of the River Ohioafter 1791.Jackson was elected as a delegate to the Tennesseeconstitutional conventionin 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, Jackson was elected itsU.S. Representative. The following year, he was electedU.S. Senatoras aDemocratic-Republican, but he resigned within a year. (His return to the U.S. Senate in 1823, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.)[11]In 1798, he was appointed a judge of theTennessee Supreme Court, serving until 1804.[12]Land speculation and founding of MemphisIn 1794, Jackson formed a business withJohn Overton"for the purpose of purchasing lands as well those lands without as within military bounds"&mdash;overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw.[13]Upon his return fromFlorida, Jackson negotiated the sale of the land from theChickasaw Nationin 1818 (termed theJackson Purchase). He was one of the three original investors who foundedMemphis, Tennesseein 1819 (seeHistory of Memphis, Tennessee).[14]Hermitage plantationEscaped slave notice placed by Andrew Jackson offering a $50 reward, plus expenses, for the return of an enslaved mulatto man who escaped from Jackson's plantation. In a move unusual for the time, the notice offers "ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of three hundred."[15]In addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered asplanter, slave owner, and merchant. He built a home and the first general store inGallatin, Tennesseein 1803. The next year he acquiredthe Hermitage, a 640-acre (259&#160;ha) plantation inDavidson County, nearNashville. Jackson later added 360 acres (146&#160;ha) to the plantation, which eventually grew to 1,050 acres (425&#160;ha). The primary crop wascotton, grown by enslaved workers. Starting with nine slaves, Jackson held as many as 44 by 1820, and later held up to 150 slaves, making him among the planter elite. Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves.[16][17]African Americanmen, women, and children were enslaved by Jackson on three sections of the Hermitage plantation.[17]Slaves lived in extended family units between five and ten persons quartered in 20-foot-square cabins made either of brick or logs. The size and quality of Jackson's Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times. To help slaves acquire food staples, in addition to Jackson's rations, Jackson supplied slaves with guns, knives, and fishing equipment for hunting and fishing.[17]At times Jackson paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets. The Hermitage plantation was a profit-making enterprise and Jackson, who demanded slave loyalty, permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough. Jackson at various times posted advertisements for his fugitive slaves. For the standards of his times Jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food, housing, and did not prohibit his female slaves from childbirthing.[17]Military careerJackson was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank ofcolonel. He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802.[18]War of 1812Main articles:Creek WarandBattle of New OrleansCreek campaign and treatyTreaty of Fort Jackson, 1814Jackson imposed severe terms on the Creek IndiansTreaty with the Creeks(1847)During theWar of 1812, theShawneechiefTecumsehencouraged the "Red Stick" Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements. He had unified tribes in theNorthwestto rise up against the Americans, trying to repel American settlers from those lands north of theOhio. Four hundred settlers were killed in theFort Mims massacre&mdash;one of the few instances of Native Americans killing a large number of American settlers and their African-American slaves[19]&mdash;which brought the United States into the internalCreek campaign. Occurring at the same time as theWar of 1812, the Creek campaign saw Jackson command the U.S. forces, which included the Tennessee militia, U.S.regulars, andCherokee,Choctaw, andLower Creekwarriors.Sam HoustonandDavid Crockettserved under Jackson in this campaign.Jackson defeated the Red Sticks at theBattle of Horseshoe Bendin 1814. US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle, but spared the chiefRed Eagle, a mixed-race man also known asWilliam Weatherford. After the victory, Madison's Secretary of War Armstrong ordered Major General Thomas Pinckney in April 1814 to make the surrender treaty.[20]Pinckney made moderate terms of surrender including handing over an unspecified amount of land, the construction of U.S. forts, turning over warriors who instigated hostilities, and agreeing to stop trade with foreign countries. Jackson opposed the unpopular Pinckney treaty, desiring to completely destroy the Creek nation. Jackson was promoted Major General and given charge of the Seventh Military District, replacing Major General Thomas Flournoy. Jackson, now commanding general, immediately threw out Pinckney's treaty and forced severe terms upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies, wresting twenty-two million acres in present-day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European-American settlement.[20]Jackson also confiscated land from Indians who had sided with the Americans. Jackson stated that the terms must be accepted or the tribe would be forcefully removed to Florida. On August 9, 1814, 35 Indian elder leaders signed Jackson'sTreaty of Fort Jackson. The warrior faction of the Creek nation and the British, however, did not formally recognize the treaty.[20]According to authorGloria Jahoda, the Creeks coined their own name for him,Jacksa Chula Harjoor "Jackson, old and fierce".[21]Battle of New OrleansTheBattle of New Orleans. General Andrew Jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attackingHighlanders, by painterEdward Percy Moranin 1910.Jackson's service in theWar of 1812against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success. When British forces threatenedNew Orleans, Jackson took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories. He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops. They said he was "tough as old hickory" wood on the battlefield, and he acquired the nickname of "Old Hickory". In theBattle of New Orleanson January 8, 1815, Jackson's 5,000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7,500 British. At the end of the battle, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing. The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.[22]Enforced martial law New OrleansJackson ordered the arrest of U. S. District Court JudgeDominic A. Hallin March 1815, after the judge signed a writ ofhabeas corpuson behalf of a Louisiana legislator that Jackson had arrested.[23]Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging Jackson's refusal to release the militia, after the British ceded the field of battle.[24]Jackson had claimed the authority to declaremartial lawover the entire City of New Orleans, not merely his "camp."[25]After ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, a lawyer and after intervention ofJoshua Lewis, a State Judge, who was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia, and who also signed a writ of habeas corpus against Jackson, his commanding officer, seeking Judge Hall's release, Jackson relented.[26]Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear Jackson. But they fared better than did the six members of the militia whose executions, ordered by Jackson, would surface as theCoffin Handbillsduring his 1828 Presidential campaign. Nonetheless, Jackson became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the War of 1812.[27]By a resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson received theThanks of Congressas well as aCongressional Gold Medal.[28]Alexis de Tocqueville, "underwhelmed" by Jackson, later commented inDemocracy in Americathat Jackson "...&#160;was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."[29]First Seminole WarMain article:Seminole WarsTrial of Robert Ambrister during the Seminole War. Ambrister was one of two British subjects executed by General Jackson. (1848)Jackson served in the military again during theFirst Seminole War. He was ordered by PresidentJames Monroein December 1817 to lead a campaign inGeorgiaagainst theSeminoleand Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventingSpanish Floridafrom becoming a refuge for runaway slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His directions were to "terminate the conflict".[30]Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida. Before going, Jackson wrote to Monroe, "Let it be signified to me through any channel&#160;... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."[31]Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.The Seminole attacked Jackson's Tennessee volunteers. The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable, and Jackson burned their houses and the crops. He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians. Jackson believed that the United States could not be secure as long asSpainand theBritishencouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense. Jackson capturedPensacola, Florida, with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor. He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects,Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot, who had been supplying and advising the Indians. Jackson's actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (he became known as "Sharp Knife").The executions, and Jackson's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident. Many in the Monroe administration called for Jackson to becensured. TheSecretary of State,John Quincy Adams, an early believer inManifest Destiny, defended Jackson. When the Spanish minister demanded a "suitable punishment" for Jackson, Adams wrote back, "Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory&#160;... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact&#160;... a post of annoyance to them."[32]Adams used Jackson's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by theAdams&ndash;Onís Treaty. Jackson was subsequently named Florida's military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.Election of 1824Main article:United States presidential election, 1824Jackson in 1824, painting byThomas SullyTheTennessee legislaturenominated Jackson for President in 1822. It also elected him U.S. Senator again. By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party. Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informalCongressional nominating caucus, but this had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Treasury SecretaryWilliam H. Crawfordfor President andAlbert Gallatinfor Vice President. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" and was a "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate".[33]Gallatin criticized Jackson as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office".[34]Besides Jackson and Crawford, the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and House SpeakerHenry Claywere also candidates. Jackson received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot). Theelectoral voteswere split four ways, with Jackson having a plurality. Because no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by theHouse of Representatives, which chose Adams. Jackson supporters denounced this result as a "corrupt bargain" because Clay gave his state's support to Adams, who subsequently appointed Clay asSecretary of State. As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for Adams, and Jackson had won the popular vote, some Kentucky politicians criticized Clay for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors. Jackson's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the "man of the people" had been robbed by the "corrupt aristocrats of the East".Election of 1828Main articles:United States presidential election, 1828andAndrew Jackson presidential campaign, 1828Jackson denounced the "corrupt bargain" that put Adams in the White House and laid plans for a crusade to oust Adams from office.[35]After resigning the Senate in October 1825, he continued his quest for the Presidency. The Tennessee legislature again nominated Jackson for President. He attracted Vice PresidentJohn C. Calhoun,Martin Van Buren, andThomas Ritchieinto his camp (Van Buren and Ritchie were previous supporters of Crawford). Van Buren, with help from his friends inPhiladelphiaandRichmond, revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, "restored party rivalries", and forged a national organization of durability.[36]The Jackson coalition handily defeated Adams in 1828.During the election, Jackson's opponents referred to him as a "jackass". Jackson liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out. However, it later became the symbol for theDemocratic Partywhen cartoonistThomas Nastpopularized it.[37]The campaign was very much a personal one. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wife Rachel of bigamy. Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794). Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife. Rachel died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve. He blamed the Adams campaigners for her death. "May God Almighty forgive her murderers," he swore at her funeral. "I never can."[38]Jackson also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards or morality. (He was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation work.)[39]Presidency 1829&ndash;1837Main article:Presidency of Andrew JacksonPresident Andrew JacksonNew York: Ritchie &amp; Co. (1860)Jackson's name has been associated withJacksonian democracyor the spread of democracy in terms of the passing of political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties. "The Age of Jackson" shaped the national agenda and American politics.[40]Jackson's philosophy as President followed much in the same line asThomas Jefferson, advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation.[41]Jackson's presidency held a high moralistic tone; having as a planter himself agrarian sympathies, a limited view of states rights and the federal government.[41]Jackson feared that monied and business interests would corruptrepublican values. When South Carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.Jackson believed that the president's authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics.[41]Instead of choosing party favorites, Jackson chose "plain, businessmen" whom he intended to control.[41]Jackson choseMartin Van Burenas Secretary of State,John EatonSecretary of War,Samuel InghamSecretary of Treasury,John BranchSecretary of Navy,John Berrienas Attorney General, andWilliam T. Barryas postmaster general.[42]Jackson's first choice of Cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip, especially between Eaton, Vice PresidentJohn C. Calhoun, and Van Buren.[42]By the Spring of 1831, only Barry remained, while the rest of Jackson's cabinet had been discharged.[43]Jackson's following cabinet selections worked better together.[42]InaugurationMain article:First inauguration of Andrew JacksonOn March 4, 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.[44]Jackson was the first President to invite the public to attend theWhite Houseball honoring his first inauguration. Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes. The crowd became so large that Jackson's guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken. Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President. The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside. Jackson's raucous populism earned him the nickname "King Mob".Petticoat politicsSecretary of WarJohn H. EatonMain article:Petticoat affairJackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his first years in office responding to what came to be known as theEaton affair.[45]Vicious Washington gossip circulated among Jackson's Cabinet members and their wives including Vice PresidentJohn C. Calhoun's wifeFlorideconcerning Secretary of WarJohn H. Eatonand his wifePeggy. Bitter rumors spread that Peggy was loose in her morals while working at her father's tavern when her naval officer husband was away at sea. After Peggy's husband died at sea, both Eaton and Peggy were criticized for their perceived early marriage. Initially Jackson thought thatHenry Claywas behind the gossip, but then he eventually concluded Calhoun was responsible for spreading the rumors. Both Jackson and Van Buren defended Eaton and his wife Peggy, however Calhoun's wife Floride and the wives of Jackson's pro-Calhoun Cabinet members publicly shunned both Eaton and Peggy.[45][46]Van Buren, Eaton, and Calhoun resigned office over the affair while Jackson dismissed the rest of his pro-Calhoun cabinet members except PostmasterWilliam T. Barry. Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to England, however, Calhoun's supporters in the Senate blocked the nomination giving Calhoun, who had continued to be Vice President and President of the Senate until December 1832, the deciding vote against Van Buren and blocked the nomination. Calhoun publically castigated and boasted that Van Buren's political career was over, stating the defeated nomination would "...kill him, sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick."[47]This rumor however proved to be false as Van Buren, who played a leading role in the Jackson's unofficialKitchen Cabinet, allied with Jackson and became Jackson's successor and Vice Presidential candidate in 1832. Jackson also acquired theGlobepaper that was sympathetic with him.[48][47]Indian removal policyFurther information:Indian removal,Indian Removal ActandTrail of TearsJackson's Indian Removal Act and subsequent treaties resulted in the transplantation of severalIndian tribesand theTrail of TearsThroughout his eight years in office, Jackson made about 70 treaties with native American tribes both in theSouthand theNorthwest.[49]Jackson's presidency marked a new era in Indian-AngloAmerican relations initiating a policy of Indian removal.[47]Jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates. The southern tribes included theChoctaw,Creek,Chickasaw,Seminoleand theCherokee. The northwest tribes include theChippewa,Ottawa, and thePotawatomi. Though conflict between Indians and American settlers took place in the north and in the south, the problem was worse in the south where the Indian populations were larger. Indian wars broke out repeatedly, often when native tribes, especially theMuscogeeandSeminoleIndians, refused to abide by the treaties for various reasons.[50]TheSecond Seminole War, started in December 1835, lasted over six years finally ending in August 1842 under PresidentJohn Tyler.[50]Though relations between Europeans (and later Americans) and Indians were always complicated, they grew increasingly complicated once American settlements began pushing further west in the years after theAmerican Revolution. Often these relations were peaceful, though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent, both on the part of American settlers and the Indians. FromGeorge Washingtonto John Quincy Adams, the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly; though by Jackson's time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable. The problem was especially acute in the south (in particular the lands near the state ofGeorgia), where Indian populations were larger, denser, and more Americanized than those of the north. As such, there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem, and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain Indian populations. Jackson, never one known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency.[47]This contrasted from his immediate predecessor, PresidentJohn Q. Adams, who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors, that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention.[47]Jackson's presidency thus took place in a new era in Indian-AngloAmerican relations, in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation.[47]As such, during Jackson's presidency, Indian relations between the Southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture.[49]In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated land west of theMississippi Riverbe set aside for Indian tribes. Congress had been developing its own Indian relocation bill, and Jackson had many supporters in both the Senate and House who agreed with his goal. On May 26, 1830 Congress passed theIndian Removal Act, and Jackson signed it into law. The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.[49]The passage of the bill was Jackson's first successful legislative triumph and marked the Democratic party's emergence into American political society.[49]The passage of the act was especially popular in theSouthwhere population growth and the discovery of gold onCherokeeland had increased pressure on tribal lands.The state ofGeorgiabecame involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832U.S. Supreme Courtdecision (Worcester v. Georgia). In that decision,U.S. Supreme CourtChief JusticeJohn Marshall, in writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands.[51][52]Jackson is frequently, though incorrectly, attributed with the following response: "John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it". The quote originated in 1863 fromHorace Greeley. Jackson used the Georgia crisis to broker an agreement whereby the Cherokee leaders agreed to a removal treaty. A group of Cherokees led byJohn Ridgenegotiated theTreaty of New Echotawith Jackson's representatives. Ridge was not a widely recognized leader of theCherokee Nation, and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate.[53]A group of Cherokees petitioned in protest of the proposed removal, though this wasn't taken up by the Supreme Court or the U.S. Congress, in part due to delays and timing.[54]The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren, who sent 7,000 troops to carry out the relocation policy. Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began.[55]It was subsequent to this that as many as 4,000 Cherokees died on the "Trail of Tears". By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves. Their methods earned them the title of the "Five Civilized Tribes".[54]More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration, though a few Cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the highSmoky Mountainsalong theNorth CarolinaandTennesseeborder.[56]Jackson's initiatives to deal with the conflicts between Indians and American settlers has been a source of controversy[57][58]on and off over the years,[59]especially among his political opponents at the time and ideological opponents since.[60][61]Modern historians,[62]such asArthur Schlesinger, Jr., often note the history of American conflicts with Indians[63][64]dating to long before the American revolution, and the ultimate need for a solution which Jackson and congress partly achieved. Starting around 1970, the controversy picked up again, this time with more ideological tones. Around that time, Jackson came under sharp attack from revisionist writers on the left, such as Michael Paul Rogin andHoward Zinn, often on on this issue.[65][66]In 1969Francis Paul Pruchaargued that Jackson's removal of the "Five Civilized Tribes" from the very hostile white environment in the Old South to Oklahoma probably saved their very existence.[67][68]TreatiesSouth:Treaty of Dancing Rabbit CreekChoctawSeptember 27, 1830Treaty of CussetaCreekMarch 24, 1832Treaty of Payne's LandingSeminoleMay 9, 1832Treaty of New EchotaCherokeeDecember 29, 1835Northwest:Treaty between the United States of America and the United Nation of Chippewa, Ottowa, and Potawatamie Indians[69]February 21, 1835WarsBlack Hawk WarMay&ndash;August 1832Second Seminole WarDecember 1835 to August 1842Truce: January&ndash;June 1837Second Creek WarMay&ndash;July 1836; sporadic violence in 1837Initiated reformsFile:JACKSON, Andrew-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpgBEPengraved portrait of Jackson as President.In an effort to purge the government from corruption of previous administrations, Jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments.[70]During Jackson's tenure in office, large amounts of public money were put in the hands of public officials. Jackson, who believed appointees should be hired by merit, withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies.[70]Jackson asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting. Jackson's Postmaster Barry resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances. Jackson replaced Barry withAmos Kendall, who went on to implement much needed reforms in the Postal Service.[71]Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of theElectoral Collegeby constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President.[72][73]In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of theFederal Constitutiongiving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress."[74]Jackson's time in the presidency as saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents. The Service Pension Act of 1832, for instance, provided pensions to veterans "even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need,"[75]while an Act of July 1836 enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband's pensions.[76]Rotation in office and spoils systemFurther information:Spoils systemandRotation in officebust byJohn Frazee,Princeton University Art MuseumUpon assuming the presidency in 1829 Jackson enforced theTenure of Office Act, passed earlier into law by PresidentJames Monroein 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates.[77]Jackson believed that arotation in officewas actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will.[77]Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was "a leading principle in the republican creed".[72]Jackson noted, "In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another."[78]Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. Opposed to this view however, were Jackson's supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members. In practice, this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists.[79]The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes.[80]Jackson, however, did use his image and presidential power to award his loyal Democratic Party followers by granting them federal office appointments. Jackson's democratic approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership Jackson stated "If he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me."[81]Jackson's theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called thespoils system, a practice that Jackson, ironically, didn't justify.[77]The political realities of Washington, however, ultimately forced Jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations.[82]Historians believe Jackson's presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics.[83]Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington (such as the New York Customs House; the Postal Service; the Departments of Navy and War; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades) proved to be difficult.[83]Other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices, forced political party campaign participation, and collection of assessments, did not take place until after Jackson's presidency.[84]During Jackson's presidency, those in opposition to Jackson's purging of office holders, formed theWhig Party, calling Jackson "King Andrew I" having feared his military background, and named their party after the English parliamentary Whigs who opposed eighteenth century British monarchy.[84]Nullification crisisMain article:Nullification CrisisAnother notable crisis during Jackson's period of office was the "Nullification Crisis", or "secession crisis", of 1828&ndash;1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs. Critics alleged that high tariffs (the "Tariff of Abominations") on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South. Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.The issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun, in theSouth Carolina Exposition and Protestof 1828, supported the claim of his home state,South Carolina, that it had the right to "nullify"&mdash;declare void&mdash;the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts.Robert Haynebegan by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States". Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!"&#160;&ndash; a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"[85]At thefirst Democratic National Convention, which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet, Calhoun and Jackson broke from each other politically and Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson's running mate in the1832 presidential election.[86]In December 1832, Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.In response to South Carolina's nullification claim, Jackson vowed to send troops toSouth Carolinato enforce the laws. In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers", stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of theConstitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed". South Carolina, the President declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution&#160;... forms agovernmentnot a league&#160;... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."[87]Jackson asked Congress to pass a "Force Bill" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed untilprotectionistsled by Clay agreed to a reducedCompromise Tariff. The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and Jackson signed both. The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance. The Force Bill became moot because it was no longer needed. On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, anddisunionandsouthern confederacythe real object. The next pretext will be the negro, orslaveryquestion."[88]Foreign affairsJackson's Minister to FranceWilliam C. Rivessuccessfully negotiated a reparations treaty with France in 1831.When Jackson took office in 1829 spoliation claims, or compensation demands for the capture of American ships and sailors, dating from the Napoleonic era, caused strained relations between the U.S. andFrenchgovernments.[89]The French Navy had captured and sent American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules. According to Secretary of StateMartin Van Burenrelations between the U.S. and France were "hopeless".[89]Jackson's Minister to FranceWilliam C. Rives, however, through diplomacy was able to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on July 4, 1831 that would award the U.S. ? 25,000,000 ($5,000,000) in damages.[90]The French government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties. The French kingLouis Philippe Iand his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies.[89]By 1834 the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew Jackson's ire and he became impatient. In his December 1834 State of the Union address, Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was "wholly disappointed" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France.[89]Feeling insulted by Jackson's words, the French people demanded an apology. In his December 1835 State of the Union Address, Jackson refused to apologize, stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful. Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment. The French government accepted Jackson's statements as sincere and in February 1836, American reparations were finally paid.[89]In addition to France, the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims withDenmark,Portugal, andSpain.[91]Jackson's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements withRussia,Spain,Turkey,Great Britain, andSiam. Under the treaty of Great Britain, American trade was reopened in the West Indies.[91]The trade agreement with Siam was America's first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country. As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.[91]Jackson, however, was unsuccessful in opening trade withChinaandJapan.[91]Jackson was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America. Jackson's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed.[91]Jackson's agent in Texas, Colonel Anthony Butler, suggested to take Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was later replaced toward the end of Jackson's presidency.[91]Bank veto and Election of 1832Further information:Bank WarandBanking in the Jacksonian Era1833 Democratic cartoon shows Jackson destroying thedevil's BankIn 1816 theSecond Bank of the United Stateswas charted by PresidentJames Madisonto restore the United States economy devastated by theWar of 1812.[92]In 1823 PresidentJames MonroeappointedNicholas Biddle, the Bank's third and last executive, to run the bank. In January 1832 Biddle, on advice from his friends, submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter four years before the original 20-year charter was to end.[93]Biddle's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832.[93]Jackson, believing that Bank was fundamentally a corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners, vetoed the bill.[93]Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values, believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy.[93]Jackson stated the Bank made "the rich richer and the potent more powerful."[93]TheNational Republican Partyimmediately made Jackson's veto of the Bank a political issue, attempting to undermine Jackson's popularity.[94]Jackson's political opponents castigated Jackson's veto as "the very slang of the leveller and demagogue," claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.[93]During the1832 Presidential Electionthe rechartering of the Second National Bank became the primary issue.[93]The election also demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period.[93]The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, in May 1832 nominated Jackson of Tennessee andMartin Van Burenof New York.[93]The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominatedHenry Clay, senator fromKentuckyand formerSpeaker of the House, andJohn Sergeantof Pennsylvania.[93]The Anti-Mason party, who had earlier held their convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominatedWilliam Wirtof Maryland and Amos Elmaker of Pennsylvania; both Jackson and Clay were masons.[94]The two rival parties, however, proved to be no match for Jackson's popularity and the Democratic Party's strong political networks known asHickory Clubsin state and local organization.[95]Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity.[95]Jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D.C. Jackson won the election decisively by a landslide, receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes.[95]Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes.[95]Wirt received only 8 percent of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party folded.[95]Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.[96]Removal of deposits and censureIn 1833, Jackson removed federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation.[97]Three years later, Jackson issued theSpecie Circular, anexecutive orderthat required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins). The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes, causing thePanic of 1837, which threw the national economy into a deepdepression. It took years for the economy to recover from the damage, however the bulk of the damage was blamed onMartin Van Buren, who took office in 1837.[98]Whitehouse.govnotes,Basically the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of "boom and bust," which was following its regular pattern, but Jackson's financial measures contributed to the crash. His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy bank credit, had swept the West. To end this speculation, Jackson in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with hard money&mdash;gold or silver. In 1837 the panic began. Hundreds of banks and businesses failed. Thousands lost their lands. For about five years the United States was wracked by the worst depression thus far in its history.&mdash;&#160;Whitehouse.govofficial biography ofMartin Van Buren[99]The U.S. Senate censured Jackson on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States.[100]The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Jackson-rival SenatorHenry Clay, which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and Jackson.[101]During the proceedings preceding the censure, Jackson called Clay "reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel", and the issue was highly divisive within the Senate, however the censure was approved 26&ndash;20 on March 28.[101]When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by Jackson supporters, led byThomas Hart Benton, who though he had once shot Jackson in a street fight, eventually became an ardent supporter of the president.[101][102]Attack and assassination attemptRichard Lawrence's attempt on Jackson's life, as depicted in an 1835 etching.The first recorded physical attack on a U.S. president was directed at Jackson. Jackson had ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from thenavyforembezzlement. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USSCygnettoFredericksburg, Virginia, where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave ofMary Ball Washington,George Washington's mother. During a stopover nearAlexandria, Randolph appeared and struck the President. He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson's party, including the well-known writerWashington Irving. Jackson decided not to press charges.[7]On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside theUnited States Capitol. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral ofSouth CarolinaRepresentativeWarren R. Davis,Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring.[103]Lawrence was restrained, and legend says that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane. Others present, includingDavid Crockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.Lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting. He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job. He claimed that with the President dead, "money would be more plenty" (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell". Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King&mdash;specifically,Richard III, dead since 1485&mdash;and that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.Afterwards, due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the sameProvidencethat they believed also protected their young nation. The incident became a part of the Jacksonian mythos.Slavery controversiesAnti-slavery tractsDuring the summer of 1835, controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation, as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819&ndash;1820Missouri Compromisedebates.[104]Northern abolitionists were sending anti-slavery tracts through the U.S. Postal system into the South.[104]Pro slavery Southerners objected believing the tracts were "incendiary literature" and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti-slavery tracts into the South. On July 29, a mob of 300 conservatives broke into the Post Office in Charleston, South Carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts. The Jackson Administration had Southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism.[104]However, Jackson, who demanded sectional peace, desired to placate Southerners; at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of Northern Democrats. Jackson's Postmaster GeneralAmos Kendallgave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts. Jackson angrily denounced Northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published. Jackson, who wanted the matter quickly resolved, also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers.[104]In February 1836, SenatorJohn C. Calhoun, Jackson's former Vice President, authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti-slavery tracts via the federal mail service. The bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the House. Many Southern postmasters, however, disregarded matters of federal law and simply refused to send the anti-slavery tracts.[104]Anti-slavery Congressional petitionsIn the same year another controversy took place, when abolitionists sent the U.S. House of Representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in Washington, D.C.[105]This infuriated pro-slavery Southerners, who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions. On December 18, 1835 South Carolina congressmanJames H. Hammondstrongly denounced abolitionists as "ignorant fanatics". Northern Whigs objected that anti-slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden.[105]Jackson wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly. South Carolina RepresentativeHenry L. Pinckneydrafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as "sickly sentimentality", declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery, and tabled (gag rule) all further anti-slavery petitions. Jackson leaders in Congress supported the measure, which was passed quickly and without any debate; temporarily suppressing pro-abolitionist activities in Congress.[105]Recognition of Republic of TexasIn 1835, pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government; by May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military for the time being, establishing an independentRepublic of Texas.[91]The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States. However, Jackson was hesitant with recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election.[91]The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, while Democratic candidate Van Buren was elected President. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating achargé d'affaireson the last day of his Presidency, March 3, 1837.[91]U.S. Exploring ExpeditionUSS&#160;Porpoise, abrigship laid down in 1835 and launched in May 1836 by Secretary of Navy Dickerson; used in the U.S. Exploring Expedition.Jackson initially opposed any federal exploration scientific expeditions during his first term in office.[106]The last scientific federally funded exploration expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led byStephen H. Harrimanon theRed River of the North. Jackson's predecessorJohn Q. Adamsattempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration expedition in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort. When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed Adam's expedition plans. However, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar toThomas Jeffersonand theLewis and Clark Expedition, Jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term.[106]On May 18, 1836 Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanicUnited States Exploring Expedition. Jackson put Secretary of NavyMahlon Dickersonin charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before Jackson's term of office expired. Dickerson however proved unfit for the task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, under the next President,Martin Van Buren.[106]Onebrigship,USS&#160;Porpoise, later used in the expedition; having been laid down, built, and commissioned by Secretary Dickerson in May 1836, circumnavigated the world, explored and mapped theSouthern Ocean, confirming the existence of theAntarcticacontinent.[107]Panic of 1837See also:Panic of 1837A New York newspaper blamed the Panic of 1837 on Andrew Jackson who is depicted in spectacles and top hatThe national economy during the 1830s was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills. In January 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished.[108][109]However, reckless speculation in land and railroads caused what became known as thePanic of 1837.[110]Contributing factors included Jackson's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused Western Banks to relax their lending standards. Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837, theSpecie Circular, that mandated Western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, that transferred federal monies from Eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks.[110]Jackson'sSpecie Circular, although designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, led many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver.[110]The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased.[110]The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound.[111][112]Administration and cabinetAndrew JacksonOfficial White House PortraitRalph E.W. Earl (1835)Main article:Presidency of Andrew JacksonJudicial appointmentsMain article:List of federal judges appointed by Andrew JacksonIn total Jackson appointed 24 federal judges: six Justices to theSupreme Court of the United Statesand eighteen judges to theUnited States district courts.States admitted to the UnionArkansas&#160;&ndash; June 15, 1836.Michigan&#160;&ndash; January 26, 1837.Later life and deathPhotographic copy of an 1845daguerreotypeAfter serving two terms as president, Jackson retired to hisHermitage plantationin 1837.[113]He immediately began putting the Hermitage in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son, Andrew Jr. Although he suffered ill health, Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics.[113]He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, "I will die with the Union."[114]Blamed for causing thePanic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement.[113]Jackson continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor,Martin Van Burento repudiate theSpecie Circular.[113]Jackson died at his plantation on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronictuberculosis,dropsy, andheart failure. According to a newspaper account from theBoon Lick Timesread, "[he] fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed ... but he subsequently revived ... Gen. Jackson died at the Hermitage at 6&#160;o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant. When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach. He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live."[115]In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members.[116]Family and personal lifeShortly after Jackson first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockley Donelson, the widow ofJohn Donelson. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter,Rachel Donelson Robards. At the time, Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards; he was subject to fits of jealous rage.[117]The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. However, the divorce had never been completed, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794.[118]To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made.[119]It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor. By May 1806,Charles Dickinsonhad published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to aduel. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent, vengeful man. As a result, he became a social outcast.[120]Rachel died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before Jackson took office as President. Jackson described her symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast."[121]After struggling for three days, Rachel finally died; a distraught Jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body.[121]She had been under extreme stress during the election, and she never did well when Jackson was away at war or work. Jackson blamedJohn Quincy Adamsfor Rachel's death because theWhigcampaign of 1828 had repeatedly attacked the circumstances for Jackson's wedding to Rachel. He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave Adams.[122]Jackson had three adopted sons: Theodore, an Indian about whom little is known,[123]Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and Lyncoya, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Creek War. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis in 1828, at the age of sixteen.[124]The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Samuel Donelson,Daniel Smith DonelsonandAndrew Jackson Donelsonwere the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.[125]The widower Jackson invited Rachel's nieceEmily Donelsonto serve as hostess at the White House. Emily was married toAndrew Jackson Donelson, who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on theAmerican Partyticket. The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during thePetticoat affair, and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess.Sarah Yorke Jackson, the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became co-hostess of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hostess duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836. Jackson usedRip Rapsas a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.[126]TemperamentJackson's quick temper was notorious. Brands says, "His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him and defamed even his wife, Rachel. He dueled in her defense and his own, suffering grievous wounds that left him with bullet fragments lodged about his body."[121]However, Remini is of the opinion that Jackson was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs.[127]Brands also notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper:Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt.... His close associates all had stories of his blood-curling oaths, his summoning of the Almighty to loose His wrath upon some miscreant, typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition. Given his record &ndash; in duels, brawls, mutiny trials, and summary hearings &ndash; listeners had to take his vows seriously.[128]On the last day of the presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun."[129]Physical appearanceTennessee Gentleman, portrait of Jackson, c. 1831, from the collection ofThe Hermitage.Jackson was a lean figure, standing at 6 feet, 1 inch (1.85&#160;m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64&#160;kg) on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake.Religious faithAbout a year after retiring the presidency,[130]Jackson became a member of theFirst Presbyterian ChurchinNashville.Jackson was a Freemason, having been initiated at Harmony Lodge No. 1 in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee. He was the only U.S. president to have served as Grand Master of a state's Grand Lodge untilHarry S. Trumanin 1945. His Masonic apron is on display in theTennessee State Museum. An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage.[131][132][133]Legacy and memoryJackson remains one of the most studied and most controversial Americans of the 19th century.[134][135]Historian Charles Sellers says "Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage."[136]His most controversial presidential actions included removal of the Indians from the southeast, the dismantling of the Bank of the United States, and his threat to use military force against the state of South Carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws. Not at all controversial was his great victory over the British atNew Orleansin the last battle of the War of 1812. He was the main founder of the modern Democratic Party and remains its iconic hero; he was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies.[137]Jackson on U.S. postageAndrew Jackson is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on U.S. Postage more than the usual two or three times. He died in 1845, but the U.S. Post Office did not release apostage stampin his honor until 18 years after his death, with theissue of 1863, a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the 'Black Jack'. In contrast, the firstWarren G. Hardingstamp was released only one month after his death, Lincoln, one year exactly. As Jackson was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait. In all, Jackson has appeared onthirteen different U.S. postage stamps, more than that of most U.S. presidents; only Washington, Lincoln, and Franklin (who was not a president) have appeared more often.[138][139]During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued twoConfederate postage stampsbearing Jackson's portrait, one a2-cent red stampand the other a2-cent green stamp, both issued in 1863.[140]Issue of 1863Issue of 1870Issue of 1903MemorialsSee also:List of places named for Andrew JacksonEquestrian statueof Gen.

Most of the transactions involved grants made under the 'land grab' act of 1873 that briefly opened to claim by North Carolinians all of the Indian lands in that state's transmontane west.
