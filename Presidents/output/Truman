Truman(May 8, 1884&#160;&ndash; December 26, 1972) was the33rdPresident of the United States(1945&ndash;53). As the finalrunning mateof PresidentFranklin D. Rooseveltin 1944, Truman succeeded to the presidency on April 12, 1945, when Roosevelt died after months of declining health. Four weeks later, theAlliessuccessfully concludedWorld War II; in the aftermath of the conflict, tensions with theSoviet Unionincreased, marking the start of theCold War.Truman was born inMissouriand spent most of his youth on his family's farm. In the last five months ofWorld War I, he served in combat inFranceas anartilleryofficer in hisNational Guardunit. After the war, he briefly owned ahaberdasheryand joined theDemocratic Partypolitical machineofTom PendergastinKansas City, Missouri. Truman was first elected to public office as a county official and became aU.S. Senatorin 1935. He gained national prominence as head of theTruman Committeeformed in March 1941, which exposed waste, fraud, and corruption in wartime contracts.DuringWorld War II, whileNazi Germanysurrendered a few weeks after Truman assumed the presidency, thewar with Imperial Japanwas expected to last another year or more. Truman approved the use ofatomic weapons against Japan, intending to forceJapan's surrenderand spare American lives ina planned invasion; the decision remains controversial. His presidency was a turning point inforeign affairs, as his government supported aninternationalistforeign policy in conjunction with European allies. Following the war, Truman assisted in the founding of theUnited Nations, issued theTruman Doctrineto contain communism, and passed the $13&#160;billionMarshall Planto rebuild Europe, including theAxis Powers, whereas thewartime alliedSoviet Union became the peacetime enemy, and the Cold War began. He oversaw theBerlin Airliftof 1948 and the creation ofNATOin 1949. When communistNorth KoreainvadedSouth Koreain 1950, he immediately sent in U.S. troops and gained UN approval for theKorean War.[2]After initial success, the UN forces were thrown back by Chinese intervention and the conflict was stalemated through the final years of Truman's presidency.On domestic issues, bills endorsed by Truman often faced opposition from aconservative Congressdominated by the South, but his administration successfully guided the American economy through post-war economic challenges. He said civil rights was a moral priority and in 1948 submitted the first comprehensive legislation; in addition, he issuedExecutive Ordersthe same year to start racial integration in the military and federal agencies. Corruption in Truman's administration, which was linked to certain members in thecabinetand senior White House staff, was brought up as a central issue in the1952 presidential campaign.Adlai Stevenson, Truman's successor as Democratic nominee, lost to RepublicanDwight D. Eisenhower, formerCommander of the Allied Armed Forces.Popular and scholarly assessments of Truman's presidencywere initially poor, but became more positive over time, following his retirement from politics. Truman's1948 election upsetto win a full term as president is routinely invoked by underdog candidates.Contents1Early life and career1.1World War I2Politics2.1As Jackson County judge2.2As U.S. Senator from Missouri3Vice presidency4Presidency4.1First term (1945&ndash;1949)4.1.1Assuming office and the atomic bomb4.1.2Strikes and economic upheaval4.1.3Creation of United Nations, Marshall Plan, start of Cold War4.1.4Berlin airlift4.1.5Recognition of Israel4.21948 election4.3Second term (1949&ndash;1953)4.3.1Korean War4.3.2Worldwide defense4.3.3Soviet espionage and McCarthyism4.3.4White House renovations; assassination attempt4.3.5Steel and coal strikes4.3.6Scandals and controversies4.4Civil rights4.5Administration and cabinet4.6Judicial appointments4.6.1Supreme Court4.6.2Other courts4.71952 election5Post-presidency6Death7Tributes and legacy7.1Legacy7.2Sites and honors8See also9Notes10References11Bibliography11.1Books11.2Journals11.2.1Time11.2.2The Washington Post11.2.3New York Times11.3Harry S. Truman Library &amp; Museum11.4Online sources12External linksEarly life and career[edit]Harry S. Truman was born on May 8, 1884, inLamar, Missouri, the oldest child of John Anderson Truman (1851&ndash;1914) andMartha Ellen Young Truman(1852&ndash;1947). His parents chose the name Harry after his mother's brother, Harrison "Harry" Young (1846&ndash;1916).[3]They chose "S" as his middle initial to please both of his grandfathers, AndersonShipp Truman andSolomon Young. The "S" did not stand for anything, a common practice among theScots-Irish.[4][5]A brother, John Vivian (1886&ndash;1965), was born soon after Harry, followed by sister Mary Jane (1889&ndash;1978).[6]John Truman was a farmer and livestock dealer. The family lived in Lamar until Harry was ten months old, when they moved to a farm nearHarrisonville. The family next moved toBelton, and in 1887 to his grandparents' 600-acre (240-ha) farm inGrandview.[7]When Truman was six, his parents moved toIndependence, so he could attend thePresbyterianChurch Sunday School. Truman did not attend a traditional school until he was eight.[8]As a boy, Truman was interested in music, reading, history, and karate , all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very close. As president, he solicited political as well as personal advice from her.[9]He got up at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen.[10]Truman worked as a page at the1900 Democratic National ConventionatConvention HallinKansas City;[11]his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.[12]After graduating from Independence High School (nowWilliam Chrisman High School) in 1901, Truman worked as a timekeeper on theAtchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, sleeping inhobocamps near the rail lines.[13]He worked at a series of clerical jobs, and was employed briefly in the mailroom of theKansas City Star.He returned to the Grandview farm in 1906, where he lived until entering the army in 1917.[14]During this period, he courtedBess Wallaceand proposed to her in 1911. She turned him down. Truman said that before he proposed again, he wanted to be earning more money than a farmer did.[15]Truman is the most recent U.S. president who did not earn a college degree. When his high school friends went off to the state university in 1901, Truman enrolled in Spalding's Commercial College, a Kansas City business school, but left after only one semester. Following his military service, in 1923&ndash;25 he took night courses toward a law degree at the Kansas City Law School (now theUniversity of Missouri&ndash;Kansas CitySchool of Law), but dropped out after losing reelection as county judge.[16]World War I[edit]Truman in uniform ca. 1918Truman had dreamed of going to theUnited States Military Academyat West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight.[16]He enlisted in theMissouri Army National Guardin 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillerybattery.[17]At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable20/50in the right eye and 20/400 (past the standard for legal blindness) in the left.[18]The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.[19]When the United States entered theGreat War, Truman rejoined the Guard, although as the sole male in the family he was exempt fromconscription. To his surprise, the men elected Truman as an officer, making himfirst lieutenantof a battery. Before deployment to France, Truman was sent toCamp Doniphan,Fort Sill, nearLawton, Oklahoma, for training. He ran the campcanteenwithEdward Jacobson, a clothing store clerk he knew from Kansas City; under the two men, the canteen returned $10,000 in dividends in six months.[17]At Fort Sill, Truman met Lieutenant James M. Pendergast, nephew ofThomas Joseph (Tom) Pendergast, a Kansas City political boss, a connection that was to have a profound influence on Truman's later life.[20][21]In mid 1918, about one million soldiers of theAmerican Expeditionary Forceswere in France. Promoted tocaptain, Truman in July 1918 became battery commander in an artillery battery in France. His new unit, Battery D,129th Field Artillery, 60th Brigade,35th Infantry Division, was known for its discipline problems, and Truman was initially unpopular.[17]During a sudden attack by the Germans in theVosges Mountains, soldiers began to flee. Using profanity that he had learned while working on the Santa Fe railroad, Truman encouraged his men to stay and fight; they were so surprised to hear Truman use such language that they immediately obeyed.[17]On September 26, 1918, at the opening of theMeuse-Argonne Offensive, Truman's unit joined in a massive pre-arranged assault barrage. They advanced with difficulty overpitted terrainto follow the infantry, and when they were west ofCheppy, they set up an observation post. Through his binoculars on September 27, Truman saw an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring28th Division. Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns; he ordered his men to open fire and scattered the enemy. Truman was given adressing downby his commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, but he was not court-martialed. Truman's decision probably saved American lives that day.[22][23]In other action during the Meuse-Argonne fighting, Truman provided support forGeorge S. Patton's tank brigade.[24]On November 11, 1918, his artillery unit fired some of the last shots of World War I before the armistice took effect at 11&#160;am. Under Truman's command in France, the battery did not lose a single man, and his men presented Truman with a largeloving cupafter their return to the United States.[17]The war was a transformative experience that brought out Truman's leadership qualities. Despite beginning 1917 as a family farmer who had been unsuccessful in several business ventures, Truman achieved a war record and gained leadership experience that supported his postwar political career in Missouri.[17]Young Truman was brought up in the Presbyterian and Baptist churches; he avoided revivals and sometimes ridiculed revivalist preachers. He rarely spoke about religion, which to him primarily meant ethical behavior along traditional Protestant lines. Most of the soldiers he commanded in the war were Catholics, and he got along with Jews and all denominations.[25]Politics[edit]As Jackson County judge[edit]The Trumans' wedding day, June 28, 1919At the war's conclusion, Truman was mustered out as a captain. He returned to Independence, where he married Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919.[26]The couple had one child,Mary Margaret Truman.[27]Shortly before the wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a haberdashery together at 104 West 12th Street in downtownKansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during therecession of 1921.[9]Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1934, when he did so with the aid of a supporter.[28]Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman onZionismlater played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.[29]With the help of the Kansas CityDemocraticmachineled byTom Pendergast, Truman was elected in 1922 as a County Court judge ofJackson County's eastern district&mdash;this was an administrative rather than judicial position, somewhat similar to county commissioners elsewhere.[30]Truman was not re-elected in 1924, losing in a Republican wave led by PresidentCalvin Coolidge. Two years selling automobile club memberships in the political wilderness convinced him that a public service career was safer for a man approaching middle-age who had never been successful in the private sector.[31]In 1926, Truman was elected as thepresiding judgefor the county court (similar to a county commission) with the support of the Pendergast machine, and was re-elected in 1930. Truman helped coordinate the "Ten Year Plan", which transformed Jackson County and the Kansas City skyline with new public works projects, including an extensive series of roads and construction of a newWight and Wight-designed County Court building. Also in 1926, he became president of theNational Old Trails RoadAssociation (NOTRA). He oversaw the dedication in the late 1920s of a series of 12Madonna of the Trailmonuments honoring pioneer women, which were installed along the trail.[31][32]In 1933, Truman was named Missouri's director for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of theCivil Works Administration) at the request of Postmaster GeneralJames Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote toFranklin D. Rooseveltin the1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federalpatronagejobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aideHarry Hopkinsand assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.[33]As U.S. Senator from Missouri[edit]Senate desk used by TrumanAfter serving as a county judge, Truman wanted to run for Governor or Congress, but Pendergast rejected these ideas. Truman thought that he would serve out his career in some well-paying sinecure at the county level. After four other men turned him down, Pendergast reluctantly backed Truman as a Democratic candidate for the1934 U.S. Senate electionfor Missouri.[34]During the Democraticprimary, Truman defeated two congressmen,John J. CochranandJacob L. Milligan, with the solid support ofJackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy, as were the contacts he had made statewide as a county official. Truman defeated the incumbent RepublicanRoscoe C. Pattersonby nearly 20 percentage points.[34][35][36]Truman assumed office with a reputation as "the senator from Pendergast." Although he turned over patronage decisions to Pendergast, Truman always maintained that he voted his conscience. He later defended the patronage decisions by saying that "by offering a little to the machine, [he] saved a lot".[36][37]In his first term as a U.S. Senator from Missouri, Truman spoke out against corporate greed and the dangers ofWall Streetspeculators and other moneyed special interests attaining too much influence in national affairs.[38]He was largely ignored by Democratic President Roosevelt and had trouble with getting calls to the White House returned.[36][39]During theUS Senate election in 1940,United States AttorneyMaurice Milligan and former governorLloyd Starkboth challenged Truman in the Democratic primary. Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast's imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year; the senator had remained loyal, having claimed that Republican judges (not the Roosevelt administration) were responsible for the boss' downfall.[40]St. Louisparty leaderRobert E. Hannegan's support of Truman proved crucial; he later brokered the deal that put Truman on the national ticket. In the end, Stark and Milligan both split up the anti-Pendergast vote in the Senate Democratic primary and Truman won by a total of 8,000 votes. In the November election, Truman defeated RepublicanManvel H. Davisby 51&ndash;49%.[41]In late-1940, Truman traveled to various military bases. The waste and profiteering he saw led him to use his subcommittee chairmanship in the Committee on Military Affairs to begin investigations into abuses while the nation prepared for war. A separate committee to conduct a formal investigation was set up under Truman; theRoosevelt administrationsupported this plan rather than weather a more hostile probe by the House of Representatives. Chairmanship of what came to be known as theTruman Committeemade him a national figure.[42]Activities of the Truman Committee ranged from criticizing the "dollar-a-year men" hired by the government, many of whom proved ineffective, to investigating a shoddily built New Jersey housing project for war workers.[43][44]The committee is reported to have saved as much as $15&#160;billion;[45][46][47][48]its activities put Truman on the cover ofTimemagazine.[49]According to the Senate's historical minutes, in leading the committee, "Truman erased his earlier public image as an errand-runner for Kansas City politicos" and "no senator ever gained greater political benefits from chairing a special investigating committee than did Missouri's Harry S. Truman."[50]If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible although I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.&ldquo;&rdquo;Harry Truman, one week after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941[51]Vice presidency[edit]See also:Democratic vice presidential nomination of 1944Roosevelt/Truman poster from 1944Vice PresidentHenry Wallace, though popular among Democratic voters, was viewed as too far to the left and too friendly to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers. Knowing that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term, both the President and several of his confidantes wanted to replace Wallace. Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairmanFrank C. Walker, incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurerEdwin W. Pauley, strategistEd Flynn,Chicago MayorEdward Joseph Kellyand lobbyist George E. Allen all wanted to keep Wallace off the ticket.[52]Roosevelt told party leaders he would accept either Truman orSupreme CourtJusticeWilliam O. Douglas. State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed. Truman did not campaign for the Vice-Presidential spot, though he welcomed the attention as evidence that he had become more than the "Senator from Pendergast".[53]Truman's nomination, dubbed the "SecondMissouri Compromise," was well received. The Roosevelt&ndash;Truman ticket achieved a 432&ndash;99electoral-votevictory in the election, defeating the Republican ticket of GovernorThomas E. Deweyof New York and running mate GovernorJohn Brickerof Ohio. Truman was sworn in as vice president on January 20, 1945.[54]Truman's brief vice-presidency was relatively uneventful. He cast histie-breaking voteas President of the Senate to confirm former Vice-President Henry Wallace as Secretary of Commerce.[55]Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the President and Vice President met alone together only twice during their time in office.[56]In one of his first acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast's funeral. He brushed the criticism aside, saying simply, "He was always my friend and I have always been his."[9]He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt; he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secretManhattan Project, which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb.[57]Truman had been vice president for 82 days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945.[57]That afternoon, Truman presided over the Senate as usual. He had just adjourned the session for the day and was preparing to have a drink inHouse SpeakerSam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed that President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, butEleanor Rooseveltinformed him that her husband had died after suffering a massivecerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, "Is there anything we can do for you? You are the one in trouble now!"[58][59]Presidency[edit]First term (1945&ndash;1949)[edit]Assuming office and the atomic bomb[edit]For more details on this topic, seeAtomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Joseph Stalin, Harry S Truman, andWinston Churchillin Potsdam, July 1945Shortly after taking the oath of office, Truman said to reporters:Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me what happened yesterday, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.[60][61]Upon assuming the presidency, Truman asked all the members of FDR's cabinet to remain in place, and told them that he was open to their advice. He emphasized a central principle of his administration: he would be the one making decisions, and they were to support him.[62]Although Truman was told briefly on the afternoon of April 12 that the Allies had a new, highly destructive weapon, it was not until April 25 thatSecretary of WarHenry Stimsontold him the details. Truman benefited from a honeymoon period after Roosevelt's death, and from theAllies'success in Europe, wrapping up the war there. Truman was pleased to issue the proclamation ofV-E Dayon May 8, 1945, his 61st birthday.[63][64]We have discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world. It may be the fire destruction prophesied in the Euphrates Valley Era, after Noah and his fabulous Ark.&ldquo;&rdquo;Harry Truman, writing about the atomic bomb in his diary[65]on July 25, 1945[66]In the wake of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for thePotsdam Conference. He was there when he learned that theTrinity testof the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful. He hinted toJoseph Stalinthat the U.S. was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though this was the first time the Soviets had been officially given information about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project, having learned about it (throughespionage) long before Truman did.[67][68][69]In August, the Japanese government refused surrender demands as specifically outlined in thePotsdam Declarationand with theinvasion of mainland Japanimminent, Truman approved the schedule for dropping the two available bombs. Truman always said that attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; military estimates for the invasion of mainland Japan were that it could take a year and result in 250,000 to 500,000 American casualties. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later. Japanagreed to surrenderthe following day.[70][71]Truman announces Japan's surrender. Washington, DC, August 14, 1945Supporters[b]of Truman's decision argue that, given the tenacious Japanese defense of the outlying islands, the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of lives that would have been lost invading mainland Japan. Critics have argued that the use of nuclear weapons was inherently immoral.[72]Truman strongly defended himself in his memoirs in 1955&ndash;56, stating that many lives could have been lost had the U.S. invaded mainland Japan. In 1963 he stood by his decision, telling a journalist "it was done to save 125,000 youngsters on the American side and 125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is what it did. It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life."[73]Strikes and economic upheaval[edit]See also:Strike wave of 1946The end of World War II was followed by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort were enormous, and Truman was intent on decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible. Demobilizing the military and reducing the size of the various services was a cost-saving priority. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, but fears existed that the nation would slide back into a depression. A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans. Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should steer. In addition, Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.[74]The president was faced with the reawakening of labor-management conflicts that had lain dormant during the war years, severe shortages in housing and consumer products, and widespread dissatisfaction with inflation, which at one point hit 6% in a single month.[75]Added to this polarized environment was a wave of destabilizing strikes in major industries. Truman's response to them was generally seen as ineffective.[75]A rapid increase in costs was fueled by the release of price controls on most items, and labor sought wage increases. A serious steel strike in January 1946 involving 800,000 workers&mdash;the largest in the nation's history&mdash;was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May. The public was angry, with a majority in polls favoring a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year's moratorium on labor actions. Truman proposed legislation todraftstriking workers into the Armed Forces, and in a dramatic personal appearance before Congress, was able to announce settlement of the rail strike. His proposal passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate.[76][77]For commodities where price controls remained, producers were often unwilling to sell at artificially low prices: farmers refused to sell grain for months in 1945 and 1946 until payments were significantly increased, even though grain was desperately needed, not only for domestic use, but to stave off starvation in Europe.[78]Truman withGreek Americansponge divers, Florida, 1947Although labor strife was muted after the settlement of the railway strike, it continued through Truman's presidency. The President's approval rating dropped from 82% in the polls in January 1946 to 52% by June.[79]This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration's policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections, when Republicans took control of Congress for the first time since 1930. The80th Congressincluded Republican freshmen who would become prominent in the years to come, including Wisconsin SenatorJoe McCarthyand California CongressmanRichard Nixon. When Truman dropped to 32% in the polls, Democratic Arkansas SenatorWilliam Fulbrightsuggested that Truman resign; the President said that he did not care what Senator "Halfbright" said.[80][81]Truman cooperated closely with the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on domestic issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by theTaft&ndash;Hartley Act, which was enactedover Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed thePresidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the vice president.[82]As he readied for the 1948 election, Truman made clear his identity as a Democrat in theNew Dealtradition, advocatingnational health insurance,[83]the repeal of the Taft&ndash;Hartley Act. He broke with the New Deal by initiating an aggressive civil rights program, which he termed a moral priority. Taken together, it constituted a broad legislative agenda that came to be called the "Fair Deal."[84]Truman's proposals were not well received by Congress, even with renewed Democratic majorities in Congress after 1948. The Solid South rejected civil rights, as those states still enforced segregation. Only one of the major Fair Deal bills, theHousing Act of 1949, was ever enacted.[85][86]On the other hand, the major New Deal programs still in operation were not repealed, and there were minor improvements and extensions in many of them.[87]Creation of United Nations, Marshall Plan, start of Cold War[edit]Truman withIranian prime ministerMohammad MosaddeghAs aWilsonianinternationalist, Truman strongly supported creation of the United Nations, and included Eleanor Roosevelt on the delegation to the UN's firstGeneral Assembly.[88]With the Soviet Union expanding its sphere of influence through Eastern Europe, Truman and his foreign policy advisors took a hard line against the USSR. In this, he matched American public opinion, which quickly came to view the Soviets as intent upon world domination.[89]Although he claimed no personal expertise on foreign matters, Truman won bipartisan support for both theTruman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Sovietcontainment, and theMarshall Plan, which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe.[90][91]To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas.[92]As part of the U.S.Cold Warstrategy, Truman signed theNational Security Act of 1947and reorganized military forces by merging theDepartment of Warand theDepartment of the Navyinto the National Military Establishment (later theDepartment of Defense) and creating theU.S. Air Force. The act also created theCIAand theNational Security Council.[93]In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating theNational Security Agency(NSA).Berlin airlift[edit]For more details on this topic, seeBerlin Blockade.On June 23, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked access to the threeWestern-held sectorsof Berlin. The Allies had never negotiated a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, GeneralLucius D. Clay, proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone toWest Berlinwith instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war. He approvedErnest Bevin'splan to supply the blockaded city by air. On June 25, the Allies initiated theBerlin Airlift, a campaign that delivered food and other supplies, such as coal, using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to have accomplished it. The airlift worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the airlift continued for several months after that. The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.[94]Recognition of Israel[edit]President Truman in the Oval Office, receiving aHanukkahMenorahfrom the Prime Minister of Israel,David Ben-Gurion(center). To the right isAbba Eban, Ambassador of Israel to the U.S.Truman had long taken an interest in the history of the Middle East, and had read many books on ancient history and the events related in the Bible. He was sympathetic to those who sought a Jewish homeland inMandatory Palestine. As a senator, he had assured Jewish leaders of his support forZionism, and at a 1943 rally in Chicago had called for a homeland for those Jews who survived the Nazi regime. A Jewish homeland in Palestine was widely popular in the United States, and Jewish support appeared to be important in the upcoming presidential election. However, State Department officials were reluctant to offend the Arabs, who were opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state in the large region long populated and dominated culturally by Arabs. Secretary of DefenseJames Forrestalwarned Truman of the importance ofSaudi Arabianoil in another war; Truman replied that he would decide his policy on the basis of justice, not oil.[95]When diplomats were called home from the Middle East to advise Truman and express their concerns about trying to set up a Jewish state in the midst of the Arab-majority region, Truman told them he had few Arabs among his constituents.[96]American policy makers in 1947&ndash;48 agreed that the highest foreign policy objective was containment of Soviet expansion as the Cold War unfolded. From the perspective of many officials, Palestine was secondary to the goal of protecting the "Northern Tier" of Greece, Turkey, and Iran from Communism, as promised by the Truman Doctrine.[97]Weary of both the convoluted politics of the Middle East and pressures by Jewish leaders, Truman was undecided on his policy. He later cited as decisive in his recognition of the Jewish state the advice of his former business partner, Eddie Jacobson, a non-religious Jew whom Truman absolutely trusted.[96]Truman decided to recognize Israel over the objections of Secretary of StateGeorge Marshall, who feared it would hurt relations with the populous Arab states. Marshall believed the paramount threat to the U.S. was the Soviet Union and feared that Arab oil would be lost to the United States in the event of war; he warned Truman that U.S. was "playing with fire with nothing to put it out".[98]Truman recognized theState of Israelon May 14, 1948, eleven minutes afterit declared itself a nation.[99][100]Truman later wrote:Hitler had been murdering Jews right and left. I saw it, and I dream about it even to this day. The Jews needed some place where they could go. It is my attitude that the American government couldn't stand idly by while the victims [of] Hitler's madness are not allowed to build new lives.[101]1948 election[edit]For more details on this topic, seeUnited States presidential election, 1948.The1948 presidential electionis remembered for Truman's stunning come-from-behind victory.[102]In the spring of 1948, Truman's public approval rating stood at 36%,[103]and the president was nearly universally regarded as incapable of winning the general election. The "New Deal" operatives within the party&mdash;including FDR's sonJames&mdash;tried to swing the Democratic nomination to GeneralDwight D. Eisenhower, a highly popular figure whose political views and party affiliation were totally unknown. Eisenhower emphatically refused to accept, and Truman outflanked opponents to his nomination.[102]Truman was so widely expected to lose the 1948 election that theChicago Tribunehad printed papers with this incorrect headline before all the returns were in.At the1948 Democratic National Convention, Truman attempted to unify the party with a vaguecivil rightsplank in the party platform. His intention was to assuage the internal conflicts between the northern and southern wings of his party. Events overtook his efforts. A sharp address given by MayorHubert HumphreyofMinneapolis&mdash;as well as the local political interests of a number of urban bosses&mdash;convinced the Convention to adopt a stronger civil rights plank, which Truman approved wholeheartedly. All of Alabama's delegates, and a portion of Mississippi's, walked out of the convention in protest.[104]Unfazed, Truman delivered an aggressive acceptance speech attacking the 80th Congress, which Truman called the "Do Nothing Congress,"[75]and promising to win the election and "make these Republicans like it."[105]Within two weeks of the convention, in 1948 Truman issuedExecutive Order 9981, raciallyintegratingthe U.S. Armed Services[106][107][108]and Executive Order 9980 to integrate federal agencies. Truman took a considerable political risk in backing civil rights, and many seasoned Democrats were concerned that the loss ofDixiecratsupport might destroy the Democratic Party. South Carolina GovernorStrom Thurmond, a segregationist, declared his candidacy for the presidency on a Dixiecrat ticket and led a full-scale revolt of Southern "states' rights" proponents. This rebellion on the right was matched by one on the left, led by Wallace on theProgressive Partyticket. Immediately after its first post-FDR convention, the Democratic Party seemed to be disintegrating. Victory in November seemed unlikely as the party was not simply split but divided three ways.[109]For his running mate, Truman accepted Kentucky SenatorAlben W. Barkley, though he really wanted JusticeWilliam O. Douglas, who turned down the nomination.[110]The campaign was a 21,928-mile (35,290&#160;km) presidential odyssey.[111]In a personal appeal to the nation, Truman crisscrossed the U.S. by train; his "whistle stop" speeches from the rear platform of theobservation car,Ferdinand Magellan,came to represent his campaign. His combative appearances, such as those at the town square ofHarrisburg, Illinois, captured the popular imagination and drew huge crowds. Six stops inMichigandrew a combined half-million people;[112]a full million turned out for a New York City ticker-tape parade.[113]The large, mostly spontaneous gatherings at Truman's whistle-stop events were an important sign of a change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national press corps. It continued reporting RepublicanThomas Dewey's apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press' inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone, but many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not yet own a telephone.[114]This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed. An unintended and undetected projection error may have contributed to the perception of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date&mdash;Roperin September, and Crossley andGallupin October&mdash;thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.[115][116]In the end, Truman held his progressive Midwestern base, won most of the Southern states despite the civil rights plank, and squeaked through with narrow victories in a few critical states, notably Ohio, California, and Illinois. The final tally showed that the president had secured 303 electoral votes, Dewey 189, and Thurmond only 39. Henry Wallace got none. The defining image of the campaign came after Election Day, when an ecstatic Truman held aloft the erroneous front page of theChicago Tribunewith a huge headline proclaiming "Dewey Defeats Truman."[117]Second term (1949&ndash;1953)[edit]Truman's inauguration was the first ever televised nationally.[118]His second term was grueling, primarily because of foreign policy challenges connected directly or indirectly to his policy ofcontainment. He quickly had to come to terms with the end of the American nuclear monopoly; using information gained by its espionage networks in the U.S., the Soviet Union'satomic bomb projectprogressed much faster than had been expected, and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S.hydrogen bomb.[119]Korean War[edit]For more details on this topic, seeKorean War.President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency that initiated U.S. involvement in the Korean WarOn June 25, 1950,Kim Il-sung's NorthKorean People's Armyinvaded South Korea, starting theKorean War. In the early weeks of the war, the North Koreans easily pushed back their southern counterparts.[120]Truman called for a naval blockade of Korea, only to learn that due to budget cutbacks, the U.S. Navy could not enforce such a measure.[121]Truman promptly urged the United Nations to intervene; it did, authorizing troops under the UN flag led by U.S. GeneralDouglas MacArthur.Truman decided that he did not need formal authorization from Congress, believing that most legislators supported his position; this would come back to haunt him later, when the stalemated conflict was dubbed "Mr. Truman's War" by legislators.[120]However, on July 3, 1950, Truman did give Senate Majority LeaderScott W. Lucasa draft resolution titled "Joint Resolution Expressing Approval of the Action Taken in Korea". Lucas said Congress supported the use of force, that the formal resolution would pass but was unnecessary, and that the consensus in Congress was to acquiesce. Truman responded that he did not want "to appear to be trying to get around Congress and use extra-Constitutional powers," and added that it was "up to Congress whether such a resolution should be introduced."[122][unreliable source?]By August 1950, U.S. troops pouring into South Korea under UN auspices were able to stabilize the situation.[123]Responding to criticism over readiness, Truman fired his Secretary of Defense,Louis A. Johnson, replacing him with the retired General Marshall. With UN approval, Truman decided on a "rollback" policy&mdash;conquest of North Korea.[124]UN forces led by GeneralDouglas MacArthurled the counterattack, scoring a stunning surprise victory with an amphibious landing at theBattle of Inchonthat nearly trapped the invaders. UN forces marched north, toward theYalu Riverboundary with China, with the goal of reuniting Korea under UN auspices.[125]However, China surprised the UN forces with a large-scale invasion in November. The UN forces were forced back to below the38th parallel, then recovered.[126]By early 1951 the war became a fierce stalemate at about the 38th parallel where it had begun. Truman rejected MacArthur's request to attack Chinese supply bases north of the Yalu, but MacArthur promoted his plan to Republican House leaderJoseph Martin, who leaked it to the press. Truman was gravely concerned that further escalation of the war might lead to open conflict with the Soviet Union, which was already supplying weapons and providing warplanes (with Korean markings and Soviet aircrew). Therefore, on April 11, 1951, Truman fired MacArthur from his commands.[127]Giving Them More HellI fired him [MacArthur] because he wouldn't respect the authority of the President... I didn't fire him because he was a dumb son of a bitch, although he was, but that's not against the law for generals. If it was, half to three-quarters of them would be in jail.[128]Harry S. Truman to biographerMerle Miller, 1972, posthumously quoted inTimemagazine, 1973.Thedismissal of General Douglas MacArthurwas among the least politically popular decisions in presidential history. Truman's approval ratings plummeted, and he faced calls for hisimpeachmentfrom, among others, SenatorRobert A. Taft.[129]Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, supported and applauded Truman's decision. MacArthur meanwhile returned to the U.S. to a hero's welcome, and addressed a joint session of Congress, a speech which the President called "a bunch of damn bullshit."[130]The war remained a frustrating stalemate for two years, with over 30,000 Americans killed, until an armistice ended the fighting in 1953.[131]In February 1952, Truman's approval mark stood at 22% according toGallup polls, which was, untilGeorge W. Bushin 2008, the all-time lowest approval mark for an active American president.[132]Worldwide defense[edit]Truman and Indian Prime MinisterJawaharlal Nehruduring Nehru's visit to the United States, October 1949The escalation of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman's approval ofNSC-68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the U.S. and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document was drafted byPaul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for building up the U.S. both militarily and economically.[133]Early in Truman's second term, his former Secretary of Defense Forrestal died soon after his retirement. Forrestal had become exhausted through years of hard labor during and after the war, and began to sufferdepression. He retired in March 1949; soon after, he was hospitalized but he committedsuicidein May.[134]Truman was a strong supporter of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called theWarsaw Pact.[135][136]General Marshall was Truman's principal adviser on foreign policy matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid toChiang Kai-shekand his Nationalist Chinese forces in theChinese Civil Warwith their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers&mdash;he thought that even propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources in Europe needed to deter the Soviets.[137]When the communists took control of the mainland, driving the Nationalists toTaiwanand establishing thePeople's Republic of China, Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the U.S. and the new government, but Mao was unwilling.[138]On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy'sSeventh Fleetinto theTaiwan Straitto prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and theRepublic of China(ROC) on Taiwan.[139][140]Soviet espionage and McCarthyism[edit]In August 1948,Whittaker Chambers, a former spy for the Soviets and a senior editor atTimemagazine, testified before theHouse Un-American Activities Committee(HUAC). He said that an underground communist network had been working within the U.S. government since the 1930s, of which Chambers had been a member, along withAlger Hiss, until recently a senior State Department official. Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for his denials under oath. The Soviet Union's success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude that subversion by Soviet spies was responsible, and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence.[141][142]However, Truman did not fully share such opinions. He famously called the Hiss trial a "red herring," and the Justice Department was moving to indict Chambers instead of Hiss for perjury.[143]Following Hiss' conviction, Secretary of StateDean Achesonannounced that he stood by him. This and other events, such as the revelation that British atomic bomb scientistKlaus Fuchswas a spy, led current and former members of HUAC, including Congressman Nixon of California andKarl Mundtof South Dakota, to decry Truman and his administration, especially the State Department, as soft on communism. Wisconsin Senator McCarthy used aLincoln Dayspeech inWheeling, West Virginiato accuse the State Department of harboring communists, and rode the controversy to political fame.[144]In the following years, Republicans used Hiss' conviction to castigate the Democrats for harboring communists in government; Congressman Nixongained election to the Senate in 1950on an anti-communist platform, defeating the liberalHelen Gahagan Douglas, whom he called "the Pink Lady."[145]Charges that Soviet agents had infiltrated the government were believed by 78% of the people in 1946, and became a major campaign issue for Eisenhower in 1952.[146]Truman was reluctant to take a more radical stance because he feared that the full disclosure of the extent of the communist infiltration would reflect badly on the Democratic Party. It was a time of theRed Scare. In a 1956 interview, Truman denied that Alger Hiss had ever been a communist, a full six years after Hiss' conviction for perjury on this topic.[147]In 1949 Truman described American communist leaders, whom his administrationwas prosecuting, as "traitors," but in 1950 he vetoed theMcCarran Internal Security Act. It was passed over his veto.[148]Truman would later state in private conversations with friends that his creation of a loyalty program had been a "terrible" mistake.[149]White House renovations; assassination attempt[edit]Main articles:White House ReconstructionandTruman assassination attemptView of the interior shell of the White House during renovation in 1950In 1948, Truman ordered an addition to the exterior of theWhite House: a second-floor balcony in the south portico, which came to be known as the "Truman Balcony." The addition was unpopular; some said it spoiled the appearance of the south facade, but it gave the First Family more living space.[150][151][152]The work uncovered structural faults which led engineering experts to conclude that the building, much of it over 130 years old, was in a dangerously dilapidated condition. That August, a section of floor collapsed, and Truman's bedroom and bathroom were closed as unsafe. No public announcement about the serious structural problems of the White House was made until after the 1948 election had been won. By then Truman had been informed that his new balcony was the only part of the building that was sound.The Truman family moved into nearbyBlair Houseduring the renovations. As the newerWest Wing, including theOval Office, remained open, Truman walked to and from his work across the street each morning and afternoon. In due course, the decision was made to demolish and rebuild the whole interior of the main White House, as well as excavate new basement levels and underpin the foundations. The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.[153]External videoNewsreel scenes in English of the assassination attempt on U.S. President Harry S. TrumanOn November 1, 1950,Puerto RicannationalistsGriselio TorresolaandOscar Collazoattempted to assassinate Truman at Blair House. The attack drew new attention to security concerns surrounding Truman's residence at Blair House. He had jumped up from a nap, and was watching the gunfight from his open bedroom window until Secret Service agents shouted at him to take cover. On the street outside the residence, Torresola mortally wounded a White House policeman,Leslie Coffelt. Before he died, the officer shot and killed Torresola. Collazo was wounded, stopped before he entered the house. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in 1952. Truman commuted his sentence to life in prison. To try to settle the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed aplebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952to determine the status of its relationship to the U.S. Nearly 82% of the people voted in favor of a new constitution for theEstado Libre Associado,a continued 'associated free state.'[154]Steel and coal strikes[edit]For more details on this topic, see1952 steel strike.In response to a labor/management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and price controls, Truman instructed hisSecretary of Commerce,Charles W. Sawyer, to take control of a number of the nation's steel mills in April 1952. Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions to be used in the war in Korea. The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a majorseparation-of-powersdecision,Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer(1952). The 6&ndash;3 decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt. The high court's reversal of Truman's order was one of the notable defeats of his presidency.[155]Scandals and controversies[edit]In 1950, the Senate, led byEstes Kefauver, investigated numerous charges of corruption among senior administration officials, some of whom receivedfur coatsanddeep freezersin exchange for favors. A large number of employees of theInternal Revenue Bureau(today the IRS) were accepting bribes; 166 employees either resigned or were fired in 1950,[156]with many soon facing indictment. When Attorney GeneralJ. Howard McGrathfired the special prosecutor in early 1952 for being too zealous, Truman fired McGrath.[157]Truman submitted a reorganization plan to reform the IRB; Congress passed it, but the corruption was a major issue in the 1952 presidential election.[158][159]On December 6, 1950, music criticPaul Humewrote a critical review of a concert by the president's daughter Margaret Truman:Miss Truman is a unique American phenomenon with a pleasant voice of little size and fair quality... [she] cannot sing very well... is flat a good deal of the time&mdash;more last night than at any time we have heard her in past years... has not improved in the years we have heard her... [and] still cannot sing with anything approaching professional finish.[160]Harry Truman wrote a scathing response:I've just read your lousy review of Margaret's concert. I've come to the conclusion that you are an 'eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay.' It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. When you write such poppy-cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you're off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work. Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below!Pegler, a gutter snipe, is a gentleman alongside you. I hope you'll accept that statement as a worse insult than a reflection on your ancestry.[160]Truman was criticized by many for the letter. However, he pointed out that he wrote it as a loving father and not as the president.[161][162][163]In 1951,William M. Boyle, Truman's long-time friend and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was forced to resign after being charged with financial corruption.Civil rights[edit]TheChicago Defenderannounces Executive Order 9980 andExecutive Order 9981.Further information:President's Committee on Civil RightsA 1947 report by the Truman administration titledTo Secure These Rightspresented a detailed ten-point agenda of civil rights reforms. In February 1948, the president submitted a civil rights agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such asvoting rightsandfair employmentpractices.[164]This provoked a storm of criticism from Southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: "My forebears were Confederates... but my very stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten."[165]Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were a major factor in his decision to issueExecutive Order 9981, in July 1948, desegregating and requiring equal opportunity in the Armed Forces.[166]After several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, theCommittee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunityand the various branches of the military, Army units became racially integrated.[167]Another executive order, also in 1948, made it illegal to discriminate against persons applying for civil service positions based on race. A third, in 1951, established theCommittee on Government Contract Compliance(CGCC). This committee ensured that defense contractors did not discriminate because of race.[168][169]Administration and cabinet[edit]All of the cabinet members when Truman became president in 1945 had been appointed by Franklin D.

Clark&#160;&ndash; 1949Sherman Minton&#160;&ndash; 1949Truman's judicial appointments have been called by critics "inexcusable."[170]A former Truman aide confided that it was the weakest aspect of Truman's presidency.[170]TheNew York Timescondemned the appointments ofTom C. ClarkandSherman Mintonin particular as examples of cronyism and favoritism for unqualified candidates.[170]The four justices appointed by Truman joined with JusticesFelix Frankfurter,Robert H. Jackson, andStanley Reedto create a substantial seven-member conservative bloc on the Supreme Court.[170]This returned the court for a time to the conservatism of the 1920s.[170]Other courts[edit]Main article:List of federal judges appointed by Harry S. TrumanIn addition to his four Supreme Court appointments, Truman appointed 27 judges to thecourts of appeals, and 101 judges tofederal district courts.[171]1952 election[edit]For more details on this topic, seeUnited States presidential election, 1952.From left: President Harry S. Truman, Vice Presidential nominee,AlabamaSenatorJohn J. Sparkmanand presidential nominee,Illinois GovernorAdlai Stevenson.Oval Office, 1952In 1951, the U.S. ratified the22nd Amendment, making a president ineligible for election to a third term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two remaining years of a term of a previously elected president. The latter clause would have applied to Truman's situation in 1952 except that agrandfather clausein the amendment explicitly excluded the amendment from applying to the incumbent president.[172]At the time of the 1952 New Hampshire primary, no candidate had won Truman's backing. His first choice, Chief JusticeFred M. Vinson, had declined to run; Illinois GovernorAdlai Stevensonhad also turned Truman down, Vice President Barkley was considered too old,[173][174]and Truman distrusted and disliked Senator Kefauver, who had made a name for himself by his investigations of the Truman administration scandals. Truman had hoped to recruit General Eisenhower as a Democratic candidate, but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination. Accordingly, Truman let his name be entered in theNew Hampshire primaryby supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18 days later the president announced he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the1952 Democratic National Convention.[175]Harry S.

Seemedia help.Eisenhower gained the Republican nomination, with Senator Nixon as his running mate, and campaigned against what he denounced as Truman's failures: "Korea, Communism and Corruption". He pledged to clean up the "mess in Washington," and promised to "go to Korea."[173][174]Eisenhower defeated Stevenson decisively in thegeneral election, ending 20 years of Democratic presidents. While Truman and Eisenhower had previously been good friends, Truman felt betrayed that Eisenhower did not denounce Joseph McCarthy during the campaign.[176]Similarly, Eisenhower was outraged when Truman, who made a whistlestop tour in support of Stevenson, accused the former general of disregarding "sinister forces&#160;... Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-foreignism" within the Republican Party.[177]Eisenhower was so outraged he threatened not to make the customary ride down Pennsylvania Avenue with the departing president before the inauguration, but to meet Truman at the steps to the Capitol, where the swearing-in takes place.[177]Post-presidency[edit]Official White House portrait of Harry S. Truman byGreta KemptonUpon leaving the presidency, Truman returned to Independence, Missouri, to live at the Wallace home he and Bess had shared for years with her mother.[178]Once out of office, Truman quickly decided that he did not wish to be on any corporate payroll, believing that taking advantage of such financial opportunities would diminish the integrity of the nation's highest office. He also turned down numerous offers for commercial endorsements. Since his earlier business ventures had proved unsuccessful, he had no personal savings. As a result, he faced financial challenges. Once Truman left the White House, his only income was his old army pension: $112.56 per month.[179]Former members of Congress and the federal courts received a federal retirement package; President Truman himself ensured that former servants of the executive branch of government received similar support. In 1953, however, there was no such benefit package for former presidents,[180]and he received no pension for his Senate service.[181]Truman (seated right) and his wife Bess (behind him) attend the signing of theMedicareBill on July 30, 1965, by PresidentLyndon B. JohnsonTruman took out a personal loan from a Missouri bank shortly after leaving office, and then set about establishing another precedent for future former chief executives: a book deal for his memoirs of his time in office.Ulysses S. Granthad overcome similar financial issues with his own memoirs, but the book had been published posthumously, and he had declined to write about life in the White House in any detail. For the memoirs, Truman received only a flat payment of $670,000, and had to pay two-thirds of that in tax; he calculated he got $37,000 after he paid his assistants.[182]However, the memoirs were a commercial and critical success;[183][184]they were published in two volumes in 1955 and 1956 by Doubleday (Garden City, N.Y) and Hodder &amp; Stoughton (London):Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Year of DecisionsandMemoirs by Harry S. Truman: Years of Trial and Hope.[185][186]The former president was quoted in 1957 as saying to then-House Majority LeaderJohn McCormack, "Had it not been for the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother, sister, and I inherited from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed."[187]The following year, Congress passed theFormer Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each former president, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment.[180]The one other living former president at the time,Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.[188]Truman's predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had organized his ownpresidential library, but legislation to enable future presidents to do something similar had not been enacted. Truman worked to garner private donations to build a presidential library, which he donated to the federal government to maintain and operate&mdash;a practice adopted by his successors.[189]He testified before Congress to have money appropriated to have presidential papers copied and organized, and was proud of the bill's passage in 1957. Max Skidmore, in his book on the life of former presidents, noted that Truman was a well-read man, especially in history. Skidmore added that the presidential papers legislation and the founding of his library "was the culmination of his interest in history. Together they constitute an enormous contribution to the United States&mdash;one of the greatest of any former president."[190]Truman supported Adlai Stevenson's second bid for the White House in 1956, although he had initially favored Democratic GovernorW. Averell Harrimanof New York.[191]He continued to campaign for Democratic senatorial candidates for many years.[192]Upon turning 80 in 1964, Truman was feted in Washington, and addressed the Senate, availing himself of a new rule that allowed former presidents to be grantedprivilege of the floor.[193]After a fall in his home in late 1964, his physical condition declined. In 1965, PresidentLyndon B. Johnsonsigned theMedicarebill at theHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museumand gave the first two Medicare cards to Truman and his wife Bess to honor the former president's fight for government health care while in office.[192]Death[edit]Wreathat Truman's casket on the day of his funeral, December 27, 1972,Independence, MissouriOn December 5, 1972, Truman was admitted to Kansas City's Research Hospital and Medical Center with lung congestion frompneumonia. He developed multiple organ failure and died at 7:50&#160;am on December 26 at the age of 88.[178]Bess Truman opted for a simple private service at the library for her husband rather than a state funeral in Washington. A week after the funeral, foreign dignitaries and Washington officials attended a memorial service atWashington National Cathedral. Bess died in 1982; they both are buried at the Harry S. Truman Library &amp; Museum in Independence.[194][195]Tributes and legacy[edit]Legacy[edit]Truman poses in 1959 at the recreation of the Truman Oval Office at the Truman Library in 1959, with the famous "The Buck Stops Here" sign on his desk. (The reverse of the sign says, "I'm From Missouri".)Citing continuing divisions within the Democratic Party, the ongoing Cold War, and theboom and bustcycle, anAmerican Political Science Associationprize-winning 1952 book stated that "after seven years of Truman's hectic, even furious, activity the nation seemed to be about on the same general spot as when he first came to office&hellip; Nowhere in the whole Truman record can one point to a single, decisive break-through&hellip; All his skills and energies&mdash;and he was among our hardest-working Presidents&mdash;were directed to standing still".[196]When he left office in 1953, Truman was one of the most unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month that Nixon resigned.American public feeling towards Truman grew steadily warmer with the passing years; as early as 1962, a poll of 75 historians conducted byArthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.ranked Truman among the "near great" presidents. The period following his death consolidated a partial rehabilitation of his legacy among both historians and members of the public.[197]Truman died when the nation was consumed with crises inVietnamandWatergate, and his death brought a new wave of attention to his political career.[128]In the early and mid-1970s, Truman captured the popular imagination much as he had in 1948, this time emerging as a kind of political folk hero, a president who was thought to exemplify an integrity and accountability many observers felt was lacking inthe Nixon White House. This public reassessment of Truman was aided by the popularity of a book of reminiscences which Truman had told to journalistMerle Millerbeginning in 1961, with the agreement that they would not be published until after Truman's death.[198]Truman had his latter-day critics as well. After a review of information available to Truman about the presence of espionage activities in the U.S. government, Democratic SenatorDaniel Patrick Moynihanconcluded that Truman was "almost willfully obtuse" concerning the danger of American communism.[199]In 2010, historian Alonzo Hamby concluded that "Harry Truman remains a controversial president."[200]However, since leaving office, Truman has fared well inpolls ranking the presidents. He has never been listed lower than ninth, and was ranked fifth in aC-SPANpoll in 2009.[201]The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused Truman advocates to claim vindication for Truman's decisions in the postwar period. According to Truman biographer Robert Dallek, "His contribution to victory in the cold war without a devastating nuclear conflict elevated him to the stature of a great or near-great president."[202]The 1992 publication ofDavid McCullough's favorable biography of Truman further cemented the view of Truman as a highly regarded Chief Executive.[202]According to historian Daniel R. McCoy in his book on the Truman presidency,Harry Truman himself gave a strong and far-from-incorrect impression of being a tough, concerned and direct leader. He was occasionally vulgar, often partisan, and usually nationalistic&hellip; On his own terms, Truman can be seen as having prevented the coming of a third world war and having preserved from Communist oppression much of what he called the free world. Yet clearly he largely failed to achieve his Wilsonian aim of securing perpetual peace, making the world safe for democracy, and advancing opportunities for individual development internationally.[203]Sites and honors[edit]Stamp issued in 1973, following Truman's death&mdash;Truman has been honored on five U.S. postage stamps, issued from 1973 to 1999.[204]In 1956, Truman traveled to Europe with his wife. In England, he met with Churchill and received an honoraryDoctor of Civil Lawdegree from Oxford University. Across Britain he was hailed; London'sDaily Telegraphcharacterized Truman as the "Living and kicking symbol of everything that everybody likes best about the United States."[205]In 1959, he was given a 50-year award by theMasons, recognizing his longstanding involvement: he was initiated on February 9, 1909 into the BeltonMasonicLodge in Missouri. In 1911, he helped establish the Grandview Lodge, and he served as its first Worshipful Master. In September 1940, during his Senate re-election campaign, Truman was electedGrand Masterof the MissouriGrand Lodgeof Freemasonry; Truman said later that the Masonic election assured his victory in the general election. In 1945, he was made a 33° Sovereign Grand Inspector General and an Honorary Member of the supreme council at the Supreme Council A.A.S.R. Southern Jurisdiction Headquarters in Washington D.C.[206][207]Truman was also a member ofSons of the American Revolution(SAR)[208]and a card-carrying member of theSons of Confederate Veterans.[209]Two of his relatives wereConfederatesoldiers.[209][210]In 1975, theTruman Scholarshipwas created as a federal program to honor U.S. college students who exemplified dedication to public service and leadership in public policy.[211]In 2004, the President Harry S. Truman Fellowship in National Security Science and Engineering was created as a distinguished postdoctoral three-year appointment atSandia National Laboratories.[212]In 2001, theUniversity of Missouriestablished the Harry S. Truman School of Public Affairs to advance the study and practice of governance.[213]The University of Missouri'sMissouri Tigersathletic programs have an official mascot namedTruman the Tiger. On July 1, 1996, Northeast Missouri State University becameTruman State University&mdash;to mark its transformation from ateachers' collegeto a highly selectiveliberal arts universityand to honor the only Missourian to become president. A member institution of theCity Colleges of Chicago,Harry S Truman CollegeinChicago, Illinois, is named in his honor for his dedication to public colleges and universities. In 2000, the headquarters for theState Department, built in the 1930s but never officially named, was dedicated as theHarry S Truman Building.[214]Despite Truman's attempt to curtail the naval carrier arm, which led to the 1949Revolt of the Admirals,[215]an aircraft carrier is named after him. TheUSS&#160;Harry S. Truman&#160;(CVN-75)was christened on September 7, 1996.[216]The129th Field Artillery Regimentis designated "Truman's Own" in recognition of Truman's service as commander of its D Battery duringWorld War I.[217]In 1984, Truman was posthumously awarded the United StatesCongressional Gold Medal.[218]In 1991, he was inducted into theHall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of theMissouri State Capitol. In 2006, Thomas Daniel, grandson of the Trumans, accepted a star on the Missouri Walk of Fame to honor his late grandfather. In 2007, John Truman, a nephew, accepted a star for Bess Truman. The Walk of Fame is inMarshfield, Missouri, a city Truman visited in 1948.[219]Other sites associated with Truman include:Harry S. Truman National Historic Siteincludes the Wallace House at 219 N. Delaware in Independence and the family farmhouse atGrandview, Missouri(Truman sold most of the farm for Kansas City suburban development including the Truman Corners Shopping Center).Harry S Truman Birthplace State Historic Siteis the house where Truman was born and spent 11 months in Lamar, Missouri.[220]Harry S.
