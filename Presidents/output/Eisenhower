He was afive-star generalin theUnited States ArmyduringWorld War IIand served asSupreme Commanderof theAllied Forcesin Europe. He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa inOperation Torchin 1942&ndash;43 and the successfulinvasion of FranceandGermanyin 1944&ndash;45 from theWestern Front. In 1951, he became the firstSupreme Commander of NATO.[2]Eisenhower was ofPennsylvania Dutchancestry and was raised in a large family in Kansas by parents with a strong religious background. He graduated fromWest Pointand later married and had two sons. After World War II, Eisenhower served asArmy Chief of Staffunder PresidentHarry S. Trumanand then accepted the post of President atColumbia University.[3]Eisenhower entered the 1952 presidential race as aRepublicanto counter the non-interventionism of SenatorRobert A. Taft, campaigning against "communism, Korea and corruption". He won in a landslide, defeating Democratic candidateAdlai Stevensonand temporarily upending theNew Deal Coalition.Eisenhower's main goals in office were to keep pressure on theSoviet Unionand reduce federal deficits. In the first year of his presidency, he threatened the use of nuclear weapons in order to conclude theKorean War; hisNew Lookpolicy ofnuclear deterrenceprioritized inexpensivenuclear weaponswhile reducing funding for conventional military forces. In 1954, Eisenhower rejected the use of military force to help the French retain their colony of Vietnam. Congress agreed to his request in 1955 for theFormosa Resolution, which obliged the U.S. to militarily support the pro-Western Republic of China in Taiwan and continue the ostracism of thePeople's Republic of China.After the Soviet Union launchedthe world's first artificial satellitein 1957, Eisenhowerauthorizedthe establishment ofNASA, which led to thespace race. During theSuez Crisisof 1956, Eisenhower condemned the Israeli, British and French invasion of Egypt, and forced them to withdraw. He also condemned the Soviet invasion during theHungarian Revolution of 1956but took no action. In 1958, Eisenhower sent 15,000 U.S. troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to aNasser-inspired revolution. Near the end of his term, his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of theU-2 incident.[4]In his January 17, 1961farewell address to the nation, Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the dangers of corporate control of Congress and massive military spending, particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers, and coined the term "military-industrial complex".[5]On the domestic front, he covertly opposedJoseph McCarthyand contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version ofexecutive privilege. He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President,Richard Nixon. He was a moderateconservativewho continuedNew Dealagencies and expandedSocial Security. He also launched theInterstate Highway System, theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA), the establishment of strong science education via theNational Defense Education Act, and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to theAtomic Energy Act.[6]As a part of his domestic policy, he sent federal troops toLittle Rock, Arkansas, for the first time sinceReconstructionto enforce federal court orders to desegregate public schools. He also signed civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 to protect the right to vote. He implemented desegregation of the armed forces in two years and made five appointments to the Supreme Court. He was the first term-limited president in accordance with the22nd Amendment. Eisenhower's two terms saw considerable economic prosperity except for a sharp recession in 1958&ndash;59. Voted Gallup's most admired man twelve times, he achieved widespread popular esteem both in and out of office.[7]Since the late 20th century, consensus among Western scholars has consistentlyheldEisenhower as one of the greatest U.S. Presidents.Contents1Early life and education2Personal life3Early military career3.1World War I3.2In service of generals4World War II4.1Operations Torch and Avalanche4.2Supreme Allied commander and Operation Overlord4.3Liberation of France and victory in Europe5Post World War II5.1Military Governor in Germany and Army Chief of Staff5.21948 presidential election5.3President at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander5.4Presidential campaign of 19526Presidency (1953&ndash;1961)6.1Interstate Highway System6.2Foreign policy6.2.1Call-sign Air Force One6.2.2Space race6.2.3Korean War, China, and Taiwan6.2.4The Middle East and Eisenhower doctrine6.2.5Southeast Asia6.2.61960 U-2 incident6.3Civil rights6.4Relations with Congress6.5Judicial appointments6.5.1Supreme Court6.5.2Other courts6.6States admitted to the Union6.7Health issues6.8End of presidency 1960&ndash;19617Retirement, death and funeral8Legacy and memory9Tributes and memorials10Awards and decorations11Other honors12Promotions13Family tree14See also15References16Further reading16.1General biographies16.2Military career16.3Civilian career16.4Historiography and interpretations by scholars16.5Primary sources17External linksEarly life and education[edit]The Eisenhower family home,Abilene, Kansas.The Eisenhauer (German for "iron hewer/miner") family migrated fromKarlsbrunn,Germany, to North America, first settling inYork, Pennsylvania, in 1741, and in the 1880s moving toKansas.[8]Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer wasanglicizedto Eisenhower.[9]Eisenhower'sPennsylvania Dutchancestors, who were primarily farmers, included Hans Nikolaus Eisenhauer of Karlsbrunn, who migrated toLancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1741.[10]Hans's great-great-grandson, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863&ndash;1942), was Dwight's father and was a college-educated engineer, despite his own father Jacob's urging to stay on the family farm. Eisenhower's mother,Ida Elizabeth (Stover) Eisenhower, born in Virginia, of German Protestant ancestry, moved to Kansas from Virginia. She married David on September 23, 1885, inLecompton, Kansas, on the campus of their alma mater,Lane University.[11]David owned a general store inHope, Kansas, but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished. The Eisenhowers then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892, and later returned to Kansas, with $24 to their name at the time. David worked as a mechanic with a railroad and then with a creamery.[11]By 1898, the parents made a decent living and provided a suitable home for their large family.[12]Eisenhower was born on October 14, 1890, inDenison, Texas, the third of seven boys.[13]His mother originally named him David Dwight but reversed the two names after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family.[14]All of the boys were called "Ike", such as "Big Ike" (Edgar) and "Little Ike" (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name.[15]By World War II, only Dwight was still called "Ike".[8]In 1892, the family moved toAbilene, Kansas, which Eisenhower considered his home town.[8]As a child, he was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother an eye; he later referred to this as an experience teaching him the need to be protective of those under him. Dwight developed a keen and enduring interest in exploring outdoors, hunting/fishing, cooking and card playing from an illiterate named Bob Davis who camped on theSmoky Hill River.[16][17][18]While Eisenhower's mother was against war, it was her collection of history books that first sparked Eisenhower's early and lasting interest in military history. He persisted in reading the books in her collection and became a voracious reader in the subject. Other favorite subjects early in his education were arithmetic and spelling.[19]His parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading. Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children, and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline, usually from David.[20]His mother, previously a member (with David) of theRiver Brethrensect of theMennonites, joined theInternational Bible Students Association, later known asJehovah's Witnesses. The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915, though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students.[21]His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother, who felt that warfare was "rather wicked," but she did not overrule him.[22]While speaking of himself in 1948, Eisenhower said he was "one of the most deeply religious men I know" though unattached to any "sect or organization". He was baptized in thePresbyterian Churchin 1953.[23]Eisenhower attendedAbilene High Schooland graduated with the class of 1909.[24]As a freshman, he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin, and which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening. The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it, and miraculously recovered, though he had to repeat his freshman year.[25]He and brotherEdgarboth wanted to attend college, though they lacked the funds. They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions.[26]Edgar took the first turn at school, and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery.[27]Edgar asked for a second year, Dwight consented and worked for a second year. At that time, a friend "Swede" Hazlet was applying to theNaval Academyand urged Dwight to apply to the school, since no tuition was required. Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S. Senator,Joseph L. Bristow. Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition, he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy.[28]He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911.[28]Eisenhower (2nd from left) andOmar Bradley(2nd from right) were members of the1912 West Point football team.At West Point, Eisenhower relished the emphasis on traditions and on sports, but was less enthusiastic about the hazing, though he willingly accepted it as a plebe. He was also a regular violator of the more detailed regulations, and finished school with a less than stellar discipline rating. Academically, Eisenhower's best subject by far was English. Otherwise, his performance was average, though he thoroughly enjoyed the typical emphasis of engineering on science and mathematics.[29]In athletics, Eisenhower later said that "not making the baseball team at West Point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life, maybe my greatest."[30]He did make the football team, and was a varsity starter as running back and linebacker in 1912, tackling the legendaryJim Thorpeof theCarlisle Indiansthat year.[31]Eisenhower suffered a torn knee in that, his last, game; he re-injured his knee on horseback and in the boxing ring,[8][16][32]so he turned to fencing and gymnastics.[8]Eisenhower later served as junior varsity football coach and cheerleader. At West Point he played football.[33][34]He graduated in the middle of the class of 1915,[35]which became known as "the class the stars fell on", because 59 members eventually becamegeneral officers.Personal life[edit]Mamie EisenhowerEisenhower met and fell in love withMamie Geneva DoudofBoone, Iowa, six years his junior, while he was stationed in Texas.[8]He and her family were also immediately taken with one another. He proposed to her on Valentine's Day in 1916.[36]A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the pending U.S. entry into World War I. In their first 35 years of marriage, they moved many times.[37]The Eisenhowers had two sons. Doud Dwight "Icky" Eisenhower was born September 24, 1917, and died ofscarlet feveron January 2, 1921, at the age of three;[38]Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death.[39]Their second son,John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower, was born on August 3, 1922, while they were in Panama. John served in theUnited States Army, retired as a brigadier general, became an author and served asU.S. Ambassador to Belgiumfrom 1969 to 1971. John, coincidentally, graduated fromWest Pointon D-Day, June 6, 1944. He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10, 1947. John and Barbara had four children:Dwight David II, Barbara Ann,Susan ElaineandMary Jean. David, after whomCamp Davidis named,[40]marriedRichard Nixon's daughterJuliein 1968. John died on December 21, 2013.[41]Eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life, and joined theAugusta National Golf Clubin 1948.[42]He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game, to the point of golfing during winter, and ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground. He had a small, basic golf facility installed atCamp David, and became close friends with the Augusta National ChairmanClifford Roberts, inviting Roberts to stay at theWhite Houseon several occasions; Roberts, an investment broker, also handled the Eisenhower family's investments. Roberts also advised Eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs, which proved financially lucrative.[42]After golf,oil paintingwas Eisenhower's second hobby.[39]While at Columbia University, Eisenhower began the art after watchingThomas E. Stephenspaint Mamie's portrait. Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax, mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie, their grandchildren, General Montgomery,George Washington, andAbraham Lincoln.[43]Wendy Beckettstated that Eisenhower's work, "simple and earnest, rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president". A conservative in both art and politics, he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as "a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-downTin Lizzie, loaded with paint, has been driven over it."[39]Angels in the Outfieldwas Eisenhower's favorite movie.[44]His favorite reading material for relaxation were the Western novels ofZane Grey.[45]With his excellent memory and ability to focus, Eisenhower was skilled at card games. He learned poker, which he called his "favorite indoor sport," in Abilene. Eisenhower recorded West Point classmates' poker losses for payment after graduation, and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him. A classmate reported that after learning to playcontract bridgeat West Point, Eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months.[46]Early military career[edit]See also:Military career of Dwight D. EisenhowerWorld War I[edit]After graduation in 1915, Lieutenant (2nd) Eisenhower put in for assignment in the Philippines, which was denied. He served with theinfantry, initially in logistics, until 1918 at various camps in Texas andGeorgia. In 1916, while stationed atFort Sam Houston, Eisenhower was football coach for St. Louis College, nowSt. Mary's University.[47]In late 1917 while in charge of training at Ft. Oglethorpe in Georgia, Mamie had their first son.When the U.S. enteredWorld War Ihe immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas.[48]In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers. His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the newtank corps, where he was promoted to brevetLieutenant Colonelin theNational Army.[49]He commanded a unit that trained tank crews atCamp Colt&#160;&ndash; his first command&#160;&ndash; at the site of "Pickett's Charge" on theGettysburg, PennsylvaniaCivil Warbattleground. Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat, he displayed excellent organizational skills, as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel.[50]Once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to France. This time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed, just a week before departure.[51]Completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time, despite being given theDistinguished Service Medalfor his work at home.[citation needed]In World War II, rivals who had combat service in the first great war (led by Gen.Bernard Montgomery) sought to denigrate Eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty, despite his stateside experience establishing a camp, completely equipped, for thousands of troops, and developing a full combat training schedule.[52]In service of generals[edit]Eisenhower (far right) with three unidentified people in 1919, four years after graduating from West Point.After the war, Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank ofcaptainand a few days later was promoted tomajor, a rank he held for 16 years.[10]The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads in the nation. Indeed, the convoy averaged only 5&#160;mph from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as President.[53]He assumed duties again atCamp Meade,Maryland, commanding a battalion of tanks, where he remained until 1922. His schooling continued, focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it. His new expertise intank warfarewas strengthened by a close collaboration withGeorge S. Patton,Sereno E. Brett, and other senior tank leaders. Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors, who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry. Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment, and he relented.[54][55]From 1920, Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals&#160;&ndash;Fox Conner,John J. Pershing,Douglas MacArthurandGeorge Marshall. He first became executive officer to General Conner in thePanama Canal Zone, where, joined by Mamie, he served until 1924. Under Conner's tutelage, he studied military history and theory (includingCarl von Clausewitz'sOn War), and later cited Conner's enormous influence on his military thinking, saying in 1962 that "Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew." Conner's comment on Eisenhower was, "[He] is one of the most capable, efficient and loyal officers I have ever met."[56]On Conner's recommendation, in 1925&ndash;26 he attended theCommand and General Staff CollegeatFort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers.[57][58]He then served as abattalioncommander atFort Benning,Georgia, until 1927.During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Eisenhower's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat, as military priorities diminished; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs. He was assigned to theAmerican Battle Monuments Commissiondirected by General Pershing, and with the help of his brotherMilton Eisenhower, then a journalist at the Agriculture Department, he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe. He then was assigned to theArmy War Collegeand graduated in 1928. After a one-year assignment in France, Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to February 1933.[59]His primary duty was planning for the next war, which proved most difficult in the midst of theGreat Depression.[60]He then was posted as chief military aide to General MacArthur, ArmyChief of Staff. In 1932, he participated in the clearing of theBonus Marchencampment in Washington, D.C. Although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised MacArthur against taking a public role in it, he later wrote the Army's official incident report, endorsing MacArthur's conduct.[61][62]In 1935, he accompanied MacArthur to thePhilippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government in developing their army. Eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with his patron regarding the role of thePhilippine Armyand the leadership qualities that an American army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates. The dispute and resulting antipathy between Eisenhower and MacArthur lasted the rest of their lives.[63]Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities ofWinston Churchill,George S. Patton,George Marshall, andGeneral Montgomeryduring World War II. Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with MacArthur, and that a positive relationship endured.[64]While in Manila, Mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully. Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936. He also learned to fly, making a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937 and obtained his private pilot's license in 1939 atFort Lewis.[65]Also around this time, he was offered a post by thePhilippine CommonwealthGovernment, namely by then Philippine PresidentManuel L. Quezonon recommendations by MacArthur, to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned, now namedQuezon City, but he declined the offer.[citation needed]Eisenhower returned to the U.S. in December 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th Infantry atFort Lewis, Washington. In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activatedIX Corpsunder Major GeneralKenyon Joyce. In June 1941, he was appointed Chief of Staff to GeneralWalter Krueger, Commander of the3rd Army, at Fort Sam Houston inSan Antonio,Texas. After successfully participating in theLouisiana Maneuvers, he was promoted tobrigadier generalon October 3, 1941.[66][67]Although his administrative abilities had been noticed, on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations.World War II[edit]After theJapaneseattack on Pearl Harbor, Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington, where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan andGermany. He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division (WPD), GeneralLeonard T. Gerow, and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division. Next, he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division (which replaced WPD) under Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall, who spotted talent and promoted accordingly.[68]At the end of May 1942, Eisenhower accompanied Lt. Gen.Henry H. Arnold, commanding general of theArmy Air Forces, to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England, Maj. Gen. James E. Chaney. He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment, stating he had an "uneasy feeling" about Chaney and his staff. On June 23, 1942, he returned to London as Commanding General,European Theater of Operations(ETOUSA), based in London and with a house onCoombe, Kingston upon Thames,[69]and replaced Chaney.[70]He was promoted to lieutenant general on July 7.Operations Torch and Avalanche[edit]Major General Eisenhower, 1942General of the Army Eisenhower, circa 1945In November 1942, he was also appointedSupreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Forceof theNorth African Theater of Operations(NATOUSA) through the new operational HeadquartersA(E)FHQ. The word "expeditionary" was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons.[citation needed]The campaign in North Africa was designatedOperation Torchand wasplanned undergroundwithin theRock of Gibraltar. Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years.[71]French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign, and Eisenhower encountered a "preposterous situation" with the multiple rival factions in France. His primary objective was to move forces successfully onto Tunisia, and intending to facilitate that objective, he gave his support toFrançois Darlanas High Commissioner in North Africa, despite Darlan's previous high offices of state inVichy Franceand his continued role as Commander in Chief of French armed forces. The Allied leaders were "thunderstruck" by this from a political standpoint, though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation. Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move. Darlan was assassinated on December 24 byFernand Bonnier de La Chapelle. Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies, considering it a criminal rather than a military matter.[72]Eisenhower later appointed GeneralHenri Giraudas High Commissioner, who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan's commander in chief, and who had refused to postpone the execution.[73]Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower's combat command skills; during the initial phase ofErwin Rommel's move into theKasserine Pass, Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates. He also was initially indecisive in his removal ofLloyd Fredendall. He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns.[74]In February 1943, his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include theBritish Eighth Army, commanded by GeneralBernard Law Montgomery. The Eighth Army had advanced across theWestern Desertfrom the east and was ready for the start of theTunisia Campaign. Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA.After the capitulation ofAxisforces in North Africa, Eisenhower oversaw the highly successfulinvasion of Sicily. Once Mussolini had fallen in Italy, the Allies switched their attention to the mainland withOperation Avalanche. But while Eisenhower argued with Roosevelt and Churchill, who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians, the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country&#160;&ndash; making the job more difficult, by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1; nevertheless, the invasion of Italy was highly successful.[75]Supreme Allied commander and Operation Overlord[edit]Eisenhower with U.S. paratroopers of the502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment,101st Airborne Divisionon June 5, 1944, the day before theD-DayinvasionIn December 1943,President Rooseveltdecided that Eisenhower&#160;&ndash; not Marshall&#160;&ndash; would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. The following month, he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as theSupreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force(SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945.[76]He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Alliedassault on the coast of Normandyin June 1944 under the code nameOperation Overlord, the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany.From left, front row includes army officers Simpson, Patton, Spaatz, Eisenhower, Bradley, Hodges and Gerow in 1945Eisenhower, as well as the officers and troops under him, had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations, and their skill sets had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans&mdash;a beach landing assault. His first struggles, however, were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with de Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord.[77]AdmiralErnest J. Kingfought with Eisenhower over King's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific.[78]He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord, to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented, as he did.[79]Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter's concern with civilian casualties; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans, and Eisenhower prevailed.[80]He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unrulyGeorge S. Patton, by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier hadslapped a subordinate, and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy.[81]TheD-DayNormandy landingson June 6, 1944, were costly but successful. A month later, theinvasion of Southern Francetook place, and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF. Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer's end&mdash;however the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year. From then until theend of the war in Europeon May 8, 1945, Eisenhower, through SHAEF, commanded all Allied forces, and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on theWestern Frontnorth of theAlps. He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families. This prompted him to make a point of personally visiting every division involved in the invasion.[82]Eisenhower's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed. It has been called one of the great speeches of history:Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.[83]Liberation of France and victory in Europe[edit]Eisenhower with some Allied commanders following the signing of theGerman Instrument of Surrenderat ReimsOnce the coastal assault had succeeded, Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy, and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany. Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his21st Army Group's attack being made in the north, while Generals Bradley (12th U.S. Army Group) and Devers (Sixth U.S. Army Group) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively). Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving them tactical, though sometimes ineffective, latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Eisenhower's persistence, the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully, albeit belatedly,opened in late 1944, and victory became a more distinct probability.[84]In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on December 20, 1944, he was promoted toGeneral of the Army, equivalent to the rank ofField Marshalin most European armies. In this and the previous high commands he held, Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He interacted adeptly with allies such asWinston Churchill, Field MarshalBernard Montgomeryand GeneralCharles de Gaulle. He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy, but these rarely upset his relationships with them. He dealt with SovietMarshal Zhukov, his Russian counterpart, and they became good friends.[85]The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive, in theBattle of the Bulgein December 1944, which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage.[86]German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies. The British wanted Berlin, but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin, and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit. The British backed down, but then wanted Eisenhower to move intoCzechoslovakiafor political reasons. Washington refused to support Churchill's plan to use Eisenhower's army for political maneuvers against Moscow. The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon. The SovietRed Armycaptured Berlin in avery large-scale bloody battle, and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7, 1945.[87]Post World War II[edit]Military Governor in Germany and Army Chief of Staff[edit]The sphere of influence for General Eisenhower inAllied-occupied Germany.Following the German unconditional surrender, Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of theU.S. Occupation Zone, based at theIG Farben BuildinginFrankfurt am Main. He had no responsibility for the other three zones, controlled byBritain,Franceand theSoviet Union, except for the city ofBerlin, which was managed by theFour-Power Authoritiesthrough theAllied Kommandaturaas the governing body. Upon discovery of theNazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in theNuremberg Trials. He reclassified Germanprisoners of war(POWs) in U.S. custody asDisarmed Enemy Forces(DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention. Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by theJoint Chiefs of Staff(JCS) in directiveJCS 1067, but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing morefraternization.[88][89][90]In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment.[91]His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis.[92][93]In November 1945, Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army. His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping. Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding theatomic bomband relations with the SovietsTrumanwas guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and thePentagon. Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, "First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon."[94]By mid-1947, as East&ndash;West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and theGreek Civil Warescalated, Eisenhower gave up his hopes for cooperation with the Soviets and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion.[95]1948 presidential election[edit]In June 1943 a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war. Believing that a general should not participate in politics, one author later wrote that "figuratively speaking, [Eisenhower] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office". As others asked him about his political future, Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job "from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe", and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions. In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during thePotsdam Conferencethat if desired, the president would help the general win the 1948 election,[96]and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination.[97]As the election approached, other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president. In January 1948, after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcomingRepublican National Convention, Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was "not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office"; "life-long professional soldiers", he wrote, "in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason, [should] abstain from seeking high political office".[96]Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time. Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president; RepublicanThomas E. Deweywas considered the other probable winner, would presumably serve two terms, and Eisenhower, at age 66 in 1956, would then be too old.[98]President at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander[edit]The Supreme Commanders of theFour Powerson June 5, 1945, in Berlin:Bernard Montgomery, Dwight D. Eisenhower,Georgy ZhukovandJean de Lattre de Tassigny.In 1948, Eisenhower became President ofColumbia University, anIvy Leagueuniversity in New York. The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction.[99]During that year Eisenhower's memoir,Crusade in Europe, was published.[100]Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs, and it was a major financial success as well. Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by theU.S. Department of the Treasurythat Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate. This ruling saved Eisenhower about $400,000.[101]Eisenhower's stint as the president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within theCouncil on Foreign Relations, a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of theMarshall Plan, andThe American Assembly, Eisenhower's "vision of a great cultural center where business, professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature". His biographerBlanche Wiesen Cooksuggested that this period served as "the political education of General Eisenhower", since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational, administrative, and financial demands for the university. Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations, he also gained exposure to economic analysis, which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy. "Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings," one Aid to Europe member claimed.Eisenhower accepted the presidency of the university to expand his ability to promote "the American form of democracy" through education. He was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee. He informed them that his main purpose was "to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy." As a result, he was "almost incessantly" devoted to the idea of the American Assembly, a concept he developed into an institution by the end of 1950.Within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university, Eisenhower was requested to adviseU.S. Secretary of DefenseJames Forrestalon the unification of the armed services. About six months after his appointment, he became the informalChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffin Washington. Two months later he fell ill, and he spent over a month in recovery at theAugusta National Golf Club. He returned to his post inNew Yorkin mid-May, and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state. Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape, he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950, building financial support from Columbia Associates, an alumni association.Eisenhower was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the Columbia University faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using the university for his own interests. As a career military man, he naturally had little in common with the academics.[102]The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency. Meanwhile, Columbia University's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president's ties to oilmen and businessmen, including Leonard McCollum, the president ofContinental Oil; Frank Abrams, the chairman ofStandard Oil of New Jersey; Bob Kleberg, the president of the King Ranch; H. J. Porter, a Texas oil executive; Bob Woodruff, the president of theCoca-Cola Corporation; and Clarence Francis, the chairman ofGeneral Foods.As the president of Columbia, Eisenhower gave voice and form to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of American democracy. His tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership. His biographer Travis Beal Jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the Columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years.[103]The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower's resignation in December 1950, when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO), and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe. Eisenhower retired from active service as an Army general on May 31, 1952, and he resumed his presidency of Columbia. He held this position until January 20, 1953, when he became thePresident of the United States.NATO did not have strong bipartisan support in Congress at the time that Eisenhower assumed its military command. Eisenhower advised the participating European nations that it would be incumbent upon them to demonstrate their own commitment of troops and equipment to the NATO force before such would come from the war-weary United States.At home, Eisenhower was more effective in making the case for NATO in Congress than the Truman administration was. By the middle of 1951, American and European support for NATO was substantial enough to give it a genuine military power. Nevertheless, Eisenhower thought that NATO would become a truly European alliance, with the American and Canadian commitments ending after about ten years.[104]Presidential campaign of 1952[edit]Main article:United States presidential election, 1952"I Like Ike" button from the 1952 campaignPresident Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans.[105]A "Draft Eisenhower" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the1952 presidential electionto counter the candidacy ofnon-interventionistSenatorRobert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time.[106]Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, "I Like Ike". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China&mdash;matters in which he had once participated.[107][108]In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wingOld Guardof the Republican Party; his selection ofRichard M. Nixonas the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose. Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike's more advanced age.[109]1952 electoral vote resultsIn the general election, against the advice of his advisors, Eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South, refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party. The campaign strategy, dubbed "K1C2", was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues: Korea, Communism and corruption. In an effort to accommodate the right, he stressed that the liberation of Eastern Europe should be by peaceful means only; he also distanced himself from his former boss President Truman.Two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff, but did not affect the campaign. One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust. Nixonspoke out adroitlyto avoid potential damage, but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates. The second issue centered on Eisenhower's relented decision to confront the controversial methods ofJoseph McCarthyon his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance.[110]Just two weeks prior to the election, Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there. He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO; finally, he stressed a corruption-free, frugal administration at home.He defeated Democratic candidateAdlai Stevensonin a landslide, with an electoral margin of 442 to 89, marking the first Republican return to the White House in 20 years.[108]In the election he also brought with him a Republican majority in the House (by eight votes) and in the Senate (actually a tie, with Nixon providing the majority vote).[111]Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century, and at age 62, was the oldest man elected President sinceJames Buchananin 1856. (President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president at the time of his election four years earlier.)[112]Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency. (The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office wereZachary Taylor,Ulysses S. Grant,William Howard TaftandHerbert Hoover.)Presidency (1953&ndash;1961)[edit]Main article:Presidency of Dwight D. EisenhowerDue to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning, Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations.[113]After selecting his budget director,Joseph M. Dodge, Eisenhower askedHerbert BrownellandLucius Clayto make recommendations for his cabinet appointments. He accepted their recommendations without exception; they includedJohn Foster DullesandGeorge M. Humphreywith whom he developed his closest relationships, and one woman,Oveta Culp Hobby. Eisenhower's cabinet, consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader, was dubbed by one journalist, "Eight millionaires and a plumber."[114]The cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends, office seekers, or experienced government administrators. He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War.[115]The president's official photographPrior to his inauguration, he led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor addressing foremost issues; agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term, to bring the Korean War to an end, to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent, and to end price and wage controls.[116]Eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist Russia policy. His inaugural address as well was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the U. N.[117]Eisenhower made greater use of press conferences than any prior president, holding almost 200 in his two terms. While he saw a positive relationship with the press as invaluable, his primary objective in press conferences was to maintain an indispensable direct contact with the people.[118]Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism.[119]He continued all the majorNew Dealprograms still in operation, especiallySocial Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, theDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years, which had not been completed under Truman.[120]As the 1954 congressional elections approached, and it became evident that the Republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses, Eisenhower was among those blaming the Old Guard for the losses, and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP. Eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate, progressive Republican: "I have just one purpose&#160;... and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right wing wants a fight, they are going to get it&#160;... before I end up, either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won't be with them anymore."[121]Initially Eisenhower planned on serving only one term, but as with other decisions he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again. During his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955, he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP's potential candidates; the group, in addition to his doctor, concluded a second term was well advised, and he announced in February 1956 he would run again.[122][123]Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition. He personally favoredRobert B. Anderson, a Democrat, who rejected his offer; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party.[124]In 1956, Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again andwon by an even larger landslide, with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6% of the popular vote. The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations.[125]Eisenhower valued the brief respites and the amenities of an office, which he endowed with an arduous daily schedule. He made full use of his valet, chauffeur, and secretarial support&mdash;he rarely drove or dialed a phone number. He was an avid fisherman, golfer, painter, and bridge player, and preferred active rather than passive forms of entertainment.[126]On August 26, 1959, Eisenhower was aboard the maiden flight ofAir Force One, which replaced the previous Presidential aircraft, theColumbine.[127]Interstate Highway System[edit]Main article:Interstate Highway SystemRemarks in Cadillac Square, DetroitSorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.President Eisenhower delivered remarks about the need for a new highway program at Cadillac Square in Detroit on October 29, 1954Text of speech excerptProblems playing this file? Seemedia help.One of Eisenhower's enduring achievements was championing and signing the bill that authorized theInterstate Highway Systemin 1956.[128]He justified the project through theFederal Aid Highway Act of 1956as essential to American security during theCold War. It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war, hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers.Eisenhower's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U.S. Army's 1919Transcontinental Motor Convoy. He was assigned as an observer for the mission, which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast.[129][130]His subsequent experience with encountering Germanautobahnlimited-access road systemsduringthe concluding stages of World War IIconvinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System. Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country, he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations, but provide a measure of continued economic growth.[131]The legislation initially stalled in the Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project, but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by Eisenhower in June 1956.[132]Foreign policy[edit]Eisenhower with Indian Prime MinisterJawaharlal NehruU.S. President Eisenhower visitsTaiwanand itsPresidentChiang Kai-shekat TaipeiIn 1953, the Republican Party's Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch; however, the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a practical moot point.[133]At this time Eisenhower gave hisChance for Peace speechin which he attempted, unsuccessfully, to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials. Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower's presidency.[134][135]Nevertheless, theCold Warescalated during his presidency. When the Soviet Unionsuccessfully tested a hydrogen bombin late November 1955, Eisenhower, against the advice of Dulles, decided to initiate a disarmament proposal to the Soviets. In an attempt to make their refusal more difficult, he proposed that both sides agree to dedicate fissionable material away from weapons toward peaceful uses, such as power generation. This approach was labeled "Atoms for Peace".[136]The U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it, due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal. Indeed, Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons, while reducing conventional forces, and with them the overall defense budget, a policy formulated as a result ofProject Solariumand expressed inNSC 162/2. This approach became known as the "New Look", and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953.[137]In 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament. The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections. In talks located in London that year, they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower, when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections. In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria, and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S., U.K. and France.[138]At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called "Open Skies" to facilitate disarmament, which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure. Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand.[139]In 1954, Eisenhower articulated thedomino theoryin his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America. He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam, this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism, from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India. Likewise, the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico.[140]That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposedEuropean Defence Community(EDC) were serious defeats, but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism, saying "Long faces don't win wars".[141]As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC, he afterwards moved to restore Germany, as a full NATO partner.[142]With Eisenhower's leadership and Dulles' direction, CIA activities increased, to resist the spread of communism in poorer countries;[143]the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran inOperation Ajax, of Guatemala throughOperation Pbsuccess, and possibly the newly independentRepublic of the Congo (Léopoldville).[144]In 1954 Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union. With Dulles' recommendation, he authorized the deployment of thirtyLockheed U-2's at a cost of $35 million.[145]The Eisenhower administration also planned theBay of Pigs Invasionto overthrowFidel CastroinCuba, whichJohn F. Kennedywas left to carry out."[146]Call-sign Air Force One[edit]OverNew York Cityin 1953, Eastern Airlines Flight 8610, a commercial flight, had a near miss with Air Force Flight 8610, a Lockheed C-121 Constellation known asColumbine II, while the latter was carrying President Eisenhower, prompting the adoption of the unique call signAir Force Onewhenever the president was on board anyUS Air Forceaircraft. Columbine II is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public and is the only remaining presidential aircraft left unrestored and not on public display.[147][148][149]Space race[edit]Further information:Space raceOn the whole, Eisenhower's support of the nation's fledgling space program was modest until the Soviet launch ofSputnikin 1957, gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world. He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education. He rushed construction of more advanced satellites, createdNASAas a civilian space agency, signed a landmark science education law, and fostered improved relations with American scientists.[150]In strategic terms, it was Eisenhower who devised the American basic strategy of nuclear deterrence based upon thetriadof B-52 bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).[151]Korean War, China, and Taiwan[edit]Eisenhower in Korea with GeneralChung Il-kwon, andBaik Seon-yup, 1952.In late 1952 Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate. Once in office, when the Chinese began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary, he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded. His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese.[152]The National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Strategic Air Command (SAC) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China.[153]With the death of Stalin in early March 1953, Russian support for a Chinese hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue.[154]In July 1953, an armistice took effect with Korea divided alongapproximately the same boundary as in 1950. The armistice and boundary remain in effect today, with American soldiers stationed there to guarantee it. The armistice, concluded despite opposition from Secretary Dulles, South Korean PresidentSyngman Rhee, and also within Eisenhower's party, has been described by biographer Ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration. Eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable, and limited war unwinnable.[154]A point of emphasis in Ike's campaign had been his endorsement of a policy of liberation from communism as opposed to a policy of containment. This remained his preference despite the armistice with Korea.[155]Throughout his terms Eisenhower took a hard-line attitude toward China, as demanded by conservative Republicans, with the goal of driving a wedge between China and the Soviet Union.[156]Eisenhower continued Truman's policy of recognizing theRepublic of China(based inFormosa/Taiwan) as the legitimate government of China, not the Beijing regime. There were localized flare-ups when the Red Army began shelling the islands ofQuemoyandMatsuin September 1954. Eisenhower received recommendations embracing every variation of response to the aggression of the Chinese communists. He thought it essential to have every possible option available to him as the crisis unfolded.[157]The Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan was signed in December 1954. He requested and secured from Congress their "Formosa Resolution" in January 1955, which gave Eisenhower unprecedented power in advance to use military force at any level of his choosing in defense of Formoso and the Pescadores. The Resolution bolstered the morale of the Chinese nationalists, and signaled to Beijing that the U.S. was committed to holding the line.[157]Eisenhower openly threatened the Chinese with use of nuclear weapons, authorizing a series of bomb tests labeledOperation Teapot. Nevertheless, he left the Chinese communists guessing as to the exact nature of his nuclear response. This allowed Eisenhower to accomplish all of his objectives&mdash;the end of this communist encroachment, the retention of the Islands by the Chinese nationalists and continued peace.[158]Defense of Taiwan from an invasion remains a core American policy.[159]By the end of 1954 Eisenhower's military and foreign policy experts&mdash;the NSC, JCS and State Dept.&mdash;had unanimously urged him, on no less than five occasions, to launch an atomic attack against China; yet he consistently refused to do so and felt a distinct sense of accomplishment in having sufficiently confronted communism while keeping world peace.[160]The Middle East and Eisenhower doctrine[edit]Eisenhower with the ShahMohammad Reza Pahlaviof Iran, 1959.Even before he was inaugurated Eisenhower accepted a request from the British government to restore the Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) to power. He thereforeauthorized the Central Intelligence Agencyto overthrow Prime MinisterMohammad Mosaddegh.[161]This resulted in an increased strategic control over Iranian oil by U.S. and British companies.[162]In November 1956, Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British, French and Israeli invasion ofEgyptin response to theSuez Crisis, receiving praise from Egyptian presidentGamal Abdel Nasser. Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion ofHungaryin response to theHungarian Revolution of 1956. He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations, and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt.[163]Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs, which were published in 1965.[164]Eisenhower and Vice PresidentRichard Nixonwith their host, KingSaud of Saudi Arabia, Washington 1957.After the Suez Crisis the United States became the protector of unstable friendly governments in the Middle East via the "Eisenhower Doctrine". Designed by Secretary of State Dulles, it held the U.S. would be "prepared to use armed force&#160;... [to counter] aggression from any country controlled by international communism". Further, the United States would provide economic and military aid and, if necessary, use military force to stop the spread of communism in the Middle East.[165]Eisenhower applied the doctrine in 1957&ndash;58 by dispensing economic aid to shore up the Kingdom ofJordan, and by encouragingSyria's neighbors to consider military operations against it. More dramatically, in July 1958, he sent 15,000 Marines and soldiers toLebanonas part ofOperation Blue Bat, a non-combat peace-keeping mission to stabilize the pro-Western government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country.[166]The mission proved a success and the Marines departed three months later. The deployment came in response to the urgent request of Lebanese presidentCamille Chamounafter sectarian violence had erupted in the country. Washington considered the military intervention successful since it brought about regional stability, weakened Soviet influence, and intimidated the Egyptian and Syrian governments, whose anti-West political position had hardened after the Suez Crisis.[166]Most Arab countries were skeptical about the "Eisenhower doctrine" because they considered "Zionist imperialism" the real danger. However, they did take the opportunity to obtain free money and weapons. Egypt and Syria, supported by the Soviet Union, openly opposed the initiative. However, Egypt received American aid until theSix Day Warin 1967.[167]As theCold Wardeepened, Dulles sought to isolate theSoviet Unionby building regional alliances of nations against it. Critics sometimes called it "pacto-mania".[168]Southeast Asia[edit]Early in 1953, the French asked Eisenhower for help inFrench Indochinaagainst the Communists, supplied from China, who were fighting theFirst Indochina War. Eisenhower sent Lt. GeneralJohn W. "Iron Mike" O'DanieltoVietnamto study and assess the French forces there.[169]Chief of StaffMatthew Ridgwaydissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary. Eisenhower stated prophetically that "this war would absorb our troops by divisions."[170]Eisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel. After a few months with no success by the French, he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes. Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet&#160;&ndash; allied participation and congressional approval.[171]When the French fortress ofDien Bien Phufell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954, Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Vice President and the head of NCS.[172]Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of theSEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) Alliancewith the U.K., France, New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism. At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer. After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam, Eisenhower rejected the agreement, offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam.[173]Ambrose argues that Eisenhower, by not participating in the Geneva agreement, had kept the U.S out of Vietnam; nevertheless, with the formation of SEATO, he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict.[174]In late 1954,Gen. J. Lawton Collinswas made ambassador to "Free Vietnam" (the termSouth Vietnamcame into use in 1955), effectively elevating the country to sovereign status. Collins' instructions were to support the leaderNgo Dinh Diemin subverting communism, by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign.[175]In February 1955, Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem's army. After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN, commonly known as South Vietnam) in October, Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military, economic, and technical assistance.[176]In the years that followed, Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men.[177]This was due toNorth Vietnam's support of "uprisings" in the south and concern the nation would fall.[173]In May 1957 Diem, thenPresident of South Vietnam, made astate visitto the United States for ten days. President Eisenhower pledged his continued support, and a parade was held in Diem's honor in New York City. Although Diem was publicly praised, in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives.[178]After the election of November 1960, Eisenhower in briefing withJohn F. Kennedypointed out the communist threat in Southeast Asia as requiring prioritization in the next administration. Eisenhower told Kennedy he consideredLaos"the cork in the bottle" with regard to the regional threat.[179]1960 U-2 incident[edit]Main article:1960 U-2 incidentAU-2reconnaissance aircraft in flight.On May 1, 1960, a U.S. one-manU-2spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude overSoviet Unionairspace. The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an East&ndash;West summit conference, which had been scheduled in Paris, 15 days later.[180]CaptainFrancis Gary Powershad bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil. Four days after Powers disappeared, the Eisenhower Administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had "gone missing" north of Turkey. It speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged, and falsely claimed that "the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties."[181]Soviet PremierNikita Khrushchevannounced that a "spy-plane" had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot. As a result, the Eisenhower Administration, thinking the pilot had died in the crash, authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a "weather research aircraft" which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed "difficulties with his oxygen equipment" while flying over Turkey.[182]The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2, which had been recovered almost fully intact.[183]The 1960 Four Power Paris Summit between President Dwight Eisenhower, Nikita Khrushchev,Harold MacmillanandCharles de Gaullecollapsed because of the incident. Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev's demands that he apologize. Therefore, Khrushchev would not take part in the summit. Up until this event, Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union. Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit. Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that "stupid U-2 business".[183]The affair was an embarrassment for United States prestige. Further, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a lengthy inquiry into the U-2 incident.[183]In Russia, Captain Powers made a forced confession and apology. On August 19, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to imprisonment. On February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged forRudolf Abelin Berlin and returned to the U.S.[181]Civil rights[edit]While President Truman had begun the process ofdesegregatingtheArmed Forcesin 1948, actual implementation had been slow. Eisenhower made clear his stance in his firstState of the Union addressin February 1953, saying "I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces".[184]When he encountered opposition from the services, he used government control of military spending to force the change through, stating "Wherever Federal Funds are expended&#160;..., I do not see how any American can justify&#160;... a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds".[185]WhenRobert B. Anderson, Eisenhower's firstSecretary of the Navy, argued that theU.S. Navymust recognize the "customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the Navy had no part in creating," Eisenhower overruled him: "We have not taken and we shall not take a single backward step. There must be no second class citizens in this country."[186]The administration declaredracial discriminationanational securityissue, as Communists around the world used the racial discrimination and history of violence in the U.S. as a point of propaganda attack.[187]Eisenhower toldDistrict of Columbiaofficials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children.[188][189]He proposed to Congress theCivil Rights Act of 1957andof 1960and signed those acts into law. The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside theJustice Departmentand aCivil Rights Commissionto hear testimony about abuses of voting rights. Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation, they constituted the first significant civil rights actssince 1875.[190]In 1957, the state ofArkansasrefused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from theBrowndecision. Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governorOrval Faubusobey the court order. When Faubus balked, the president placed theArkansas National Guardunder federal control and sent in the101st Airborne Division. They escorted and protectednine black students' entry toLittle Rock Central High School, an all-white public school, for the first time since theReconstruction Era.[191]Martin Luther King Jr.wrote to Eisenhower to thank him for his actions, writing "The overwhelming majority of southerners, Negro and white, stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock".[192]Relations with Congress[edit]Eisenhower had a Republican Congress for only his first two years in office; in the Senate, the Republican majority was by a one-vote margin. SenatorRobert A. Taftassisted the President greatly in working with the Old Guard, and was sorely missed when his death (in July 1953) left Eisenhower with his successorWilliam Knowland, whom Eisenhower disliked.[193]This prevented Eisenhower from openly condemning Joseph McCarthy's highly criticized methods against communism. To facilitate relations with Congress, Eisenhower decided to ignore McCarthy's controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the White House. This position drew criticism from a number of corners.[194]In late 1953 McCarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the1954 Senate elections. Eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists.[195]Nevertheless, he refused.Among Ike's objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent McCarthy from dragging theAtomic Energy Commission(AEC) into McCarthy's witch hunt for communists, which would interfere with, and perhaps delay, the AEC's important work onH-bombs. The administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the AEC,J. Robert Oppenheimer, had urged that the H-bomb work be delayed. Eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance, though he knew this would create fertile ground for McCarthy.[196]In May 1955, McCarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to White House personnel. Eisenhower was furious, and issued an order as follows: "It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters&#160;... it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications, or any documents or reproductions, concerning such advice be disclosed." This was an unprecedented step by Eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting, and soon became a tradition known asExecutive privilege. Ike's denial of McCarthy's access to his staff reduced McCarthy's hearings to rants about trivial matters, and contributed to his ultimate downfall.[197]In early 1954, the Old Guard put forward a constitutional amendment, called theBricker Amendment, which would curtail international agreements by the Chief Executive, such as theYalta Agreements. Eisenhower opposed the measure.[198]The Old Guard agreed with Eisenhower on the development and ownership of nuclear reactors by private enterprises, which the Democrats opposed. The President succeeded in getting legislation creating a system of licensure for nuclear plants by the AEC.[199]The Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election.[200]Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority LeaderLyndon B. Johnson(later U.S. president) in the Senate and SpeakerSam Rayburnin the House, both from Texas.Joe Martin, the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955, wrote that Eisenhower "never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill. There were exceptions,Leonard W. Hall, for example, who as chairman of theRepublican National Committeetried to open the administration's eyes to the political facts of life, with occasional success. However, these exceptions were not enough to right the balance."[201]Speaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress, with results, "often the reverse of what he has desired" because Members of Congress, "resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'The Chief wants this'. The administration never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking."[201]Judicial appointments[edit]Supreme Court[edit]Main article:Dwight D. Eisenhower Supreme Court candidatesEisenhower appointed the followingJusticesto theSupreme Court of the United States:Earl Warren, 1953 (Chief Justice)John Marshall Harlan II, 1954William J. Brennan, 1956Charles Evans Whittaker, 1957Potter Stewart, 1958Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired. Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans, while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism.[202]In selecting a Chief Justice Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives, noting privately that Warren "represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court&#160;... He has a national name for integrity, uprightness, and courage that, again, I believe we need on the Court".[203]In the next few years Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court.Other courts[edit]Main article:Dwight D. Eisenhower judicial appointmentsIn addition to his five Supreme Court appointments, Eisenhower appointed 45 judges to theUnited States Courts of Appeals, and 129 judges to theUnited States district courts.States admitted to the Union[edit]Alaska&#160;&ndash; January 3, 195949th stateHawaii&#160;&ndash; August 21, 195950th stateHealth issues[edit]Eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at West Point, oftentwo or three packs a day. Eisenhower stated that he "gave [himself] an order" to stopcold turkeyin March 1949 while at Columbia.[46][204]He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office,[205]On September 24, 1955, while vacationing inColorado, he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks' hospitalization, during which time Nixon, Dulles, and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the President.[206]He was treated by Dr.Paul Dudley White, a cardiologist with a national reputation, who regularly informed the press of the President's progress. Instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as President, his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery.[207]As a consequence of his heart attack, Eisenhower developed a left ventricularaneurysm, which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on November 25, 1957. This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand. The stroke had caused anaphasia. The president also suffered fromCrohn's disease,[208]chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine,[209]which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9, 1956.[210]To treat the intestinal block, surgeons bypassed about ten inches of hissmall intestine.[211]His scheduled meeting withIndian Prime MinisterJawaharlal Nehruwas postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm inGettysburg, Pennsylvania.[212]He was still recovering from this operation during theSuez Crisis. Eisenhower's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits, but he still indulged in alcohol. During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29, 1959; however, before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower "drank several gin-and-tonics, and one or two gins on the rocks&#160;... three or four wines with the dinner".[213]The last three years of Eisenhower's second term in office were ones of relatively good health. Eventually after leaving the White House, he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks.[214]A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs.[215]In August 1966 he began to show symptoms ofcholecystitis, for which he underwent surgery on December 12, 1966, when his gallbladder was removed, containing 16 gallstones.[214]After Eisenhower's death in 1969 (see below), an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenalpheochromocytoma,[216]a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease. Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death.[214]End of presidency 1960&ndash;1961[edit]The officialWhite Houseportrait of Dwight D. Eisenhower.The22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitutionwas ratified in 1951, and it set term limits to the presidency of two terms. It stipulated thatHarry S. Truman, the incumbent at the time, would not be affected by the amendment. After he had been elected to his second presidential term in 1956, Eisenhower became the first U.S. president constitutionally prevented from running for re-election to the office, having served the maximum two terms.Eisenhower was also the first outgoing President to come under the protection of theFormer Presidents Act; two living former Presidents,Herbert HooverandHarry S. Truman, left office before the Act was passed. Under the act, Eisenhower was entitled to receive a lifetime pension, state-provided staff and aSecret Servicedetail.[217]In the 1960 election to choose his successor, Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President, RepublicanRichard Nixonagainst DemocratJohn F. Kennedy. He told friends, "I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy."[108]He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days, although he may have done Nixon some harm. When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon's policy ideas he had adopted, Eisenhower joked, "If you give me a week, I might think of one. I don't remember." Kennedy's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials. Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy. Eisenhower, who was the oldest president in history at that time (then 70), was succeeded by the youngest elected president, as Kennedy was 43.[108]Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.Eisenhower's farewell address, January 17, 1961. Length 15:30.On January 17, 1961, Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from theOval Office.[218]In hisfarewell speech, Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces. He described the Cold War: "We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose and insidious in method&#160;..." and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that "we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military&ndash;industrial complex."[218]He elaborated, "we recognize the imperative need for this development&#160;... the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist&#160;... Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together."[218]Because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office, Eisenhower had resigned his permanent commission asGeneral of the Armybefore entering the office of President of the United States. Upon completion of his Presidential term, his commission was reactivated by Congress and Eisenhower again was commissioned a five-star general in the United States Army.[219][220]Retirement, death and funeral[edit]Eisenhower meets withPresident Johnsonin October 1965.Eisenhower's funeral service.Graves of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Doud Dwight "Icky" Eisenhower and Mamie Eisenhower in Abilene, KansasEisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield atGettysburg, Pennsylvania, only thirty miles from his ancestral home of York. In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the farm to theNational Park Service. In retirement, the former president did not completely retreat from political life; he spoke at the1964 Republican National Conventionand appeared withBarry Goldwaterin a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg.[221]However, his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as "a dime-store New Dealer".On the morning of March 28, 1969, at the age of 78, Eisenhower died in Washington, D.C. ofcongestive heart failureatWalter Reed Army Hospital. The following day his body was moved to theWashington National Cathedral's Bethlehem Chapel, where he lay in repose for 28 hours. On March 30, his body was brought bycaissonto theUnited States Capitol, where he lay in state in theCapitol Rotunda. On March 31, Eisenhower's body was returned to theNational Cathedral, where he was given anEpiscopal Churchfuneral service.[222]That evening, Eisenhower's body was placed onto a train en route toAbilene, Kansas. His body arrived on April 2, and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of theEisenhower Presidential Library. The president's body was buried as a General of the Army. The family used an $80 standard soldier's casket, and dressed Eisenhower's body in his famousshort green jacket. His only medals worn were: the Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, and the Legion of Merit. Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud, who died at age 3 in 1921. His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979.[222]Richard Nixon, then President, spoke of Eisenhower,Some men are considered great because they lead great armies or they lead powerful nations. For eight years now, Dwight Eisenhower has neither commanded an army nor led a nation; and yet he remained through his final days the world's most admired and respected man, truly the first citizen of the world.[223]Legacy and memory[edit]In the immediate years after Eisenhower left office, his reputation declined. He was widely seen by critics as an inactive, uninspiring president compared to his vigorous young successor. Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order atCentral High Schoolin Little Rock, Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support thecivil rightsmovement to the degree that activists wanted. Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the1960 U-2 incidentand the associated international embarrassment,[224][225]for the Soviet Union's perceived leadership in thenuclear arms raceand theSpace Race, and for his failure to publicly opposeMcCarthyism.In particular, Eisenhower was criticized for failing to defendGeorge Marshallfrom attacks byJoseph McCarthy, though he privately deplored McCarthy's tactics and claims.[226]Such omissions were held against him during theliberalclimate of the 1960s and 1970s. Since that time, however, Eisenhower's reputation has risen.Recent surveysof historians since the 1980s often rank Eisenhower in the top 10 of all U.S. presidents.On June 1, 1954, this signing ceremony changedArmistice DaytoVeterans Day.HistorianJohn Lewis Gaddishas summarized the turnaround in evaluations by historians:Historians long ago abandoned the view that Eisenhower's was a failed presidency. He did, after all, end the Korean War without getting into any others. He stabilized, and did not escalate, the Soviet-American rivalry. He strengthened European alliances while withdrawing support from European colonialism. He rescued the Republican Party from isolationism and McCarthyism. He maintained prosperity, balanced the budget, promoted technological innovation, facilitated (if reluctantly) the civil rights movement and warned, in the most memorable farewell address since Washington's, of a "military&ndash;industrial complex" that could endanger the nation's liberties. Not until Reagan would another president leave office with so strong a sense of having accomplished what he set out to do.[227]Although conservatism in politics was strong during the 1950s and Eisenhower generally espoused conservative sentiments, his administration concerned itself mostly with foreign affairs (an area in which the career-military president had more knowledge) and pursued a hands-off domestic policy. Eisenhower looked to moderation and cooperation as a means of governance.[228]Although he sought to slow or contain theNew Dealand other federal programs, he did not attempt to repeal them outright, and in doing so was popular among the liberal wing of the Republican Party.[228]Conservative critics of his administration found that he did not do enough to advance the goals of the right; according toHans Morgenthau, "Eisenhower's victories were but accidents without consequence in the history of the Republican party."[229]Eisenhower meets with PresidentJohn F. Kennedy, April 22, 1961.Since the 19th century, many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or "gatekeeper", sometimes described as the President's Private Secretary, sometimes with no official title at all.[230]Eisenhower formalized this role, introducing the office ofWhite House Chief of Staff&#160;&ndash; an idea he borrowed from the United States Army. Every president afterLyndon Johnsonhas also appointed staff to this position. Initially,Gerald FordandJimmy Cartertried to operate without a chief of staff, but each eventually appointed one.As President, Eisenhower also initiated the "up or out" policy in the U.S. military, whereby officers who are passed over for promotiontwiceare usually honorably discharged to make way for younger, more able officers. Eisenhower never forgot his own frustration at being stuck at the rank of major for 16 years between the two world wars.Eisenhower foundedPeople to People Internationalin 1956, based on his belief that citizen interaction would promote cultural interaction and world peace. The program includes astudent ambassador component, which sends American youth on educational trips to other countries.[231]Frank Gasparro's obverse design (left) and reverse design (right) of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation award during Eisenhower's official visit to the State of Hawaii from June 20&ndash;25, 1960.During his second term as President, Eisenhower distinctively preserved his presidential gratitude by awarding individuals a special memento. This memento was a series of specially designed U.S. Mint presidential appreciation medals. Eisenhower presented the medal as an expression of his appreciation and the medal is a keepsake reminder for the recipient.[232]The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. The medals were struck from September 1958 though October 1960. A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858. Each of the designs incorporates the text "with appreciation" or "with personal and official gratitude" accompanied with Eisenhower's initials "D.D.E." or facsimile signature. The design also incorporates location, date, and/or significant event. Prior to the end of his second term as President, 1,451 medals were turned-in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed.[232]The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series.[232]Tributes and memorials[edit]Eisenhower is remembered for his role in World War II, the creation of theInterstate Highway Systemand ending theKorean War.Eisenhower Interstate System sign south ofSan Antonio, Texas.Bronze statue of Eisenhower atCapitol rotunda.[233]The Interstate Highway System is officially known as the 'Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways' in his honor. It was inspired in part by Eisenhower's own Army experiences in World War Two, where he recognized the advantages of theautobahnsystems in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Commemorative signs reading "Eisenhower Interstate System" and bearing Eisenhower's permanent5-star rankinsignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the Interstate System. Several highways are also named for him, including theEisenhower Expressway(Interstate 290) nearChicagoand theEisenhower TunnelonInterstate 70west ofDenver.The British A4 class steam locomotive No. 4496 (renumbered 60008)Golden Shuttlewas renamedDwight D.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower, anAugusta Nationalmember, hit the tree so many times that, at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down. Not wanting to offend the president, the club's chairman,Clifford Roberts, immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request. The tree was removed in February 2014 after an ice storm caused it significant damage.[244]During a visit to Augusta National, then General Eisenhower returned from a walk through the woods on the eastern part of the grounds, and informedClifford Robertsthat he had found a perfect place to build a dam if the club would like a fish pond. Ike's Pond was built and named, and the dam is located just where Eisenhower said it should be.[citation needed]Awards and decorations[edit]The star of the SovietOrder of Victoryawarded to Eisenhower.[245]Thecoat of armsgranted to Eisenhower upon his incorporation as a knight of theOrder of the Elephantin 1950.[246]The anvil represents the fact that his name is derived from the German for "iron hewer"U.S. military decorationsArmy Distinguished Service Medalw/ 4oak leaf clustersNavy Distinguished Service MedalLegion of MeritU.S. Service MedalsMexican Border Service MedalWorld War I Victory MedalAmerican Defense Service MedalEuropean-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medalw/ 9campaign starsWorld War II Victory MedalArmy of Occupation Medalw/ "Germany" claspNational Defense Service Medalw/ 1service starInternational and Foreign Awards[247]Order of the Liberator San Martin, Grand Cross (Argentine)Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash(Austria)[248]Order of Leopold, Grand Cordon (Belgium)Croix de guerrew/ palm (Belgium)Order of the Southern Cross, Grand Cross (Brazil)Order of Military Merit, Grand Cross (Brazil)Order of Aeronautical Merit, Grand Cross (Brazil)War Medal (Brazil)Campaign Medal (Brazil)Order of the Merit of Chile, Grand Cross (Chile)Order of Cloud and Banner, Grand Cordon, Special Class (China)Order of the White Lion, Grand cross (Czechoslovakia)War Cross 1939&ndash;1945(Czechoslovakia)Order of the Elephant, Knight (Denmark)Order of Abdon Calderón, First Class (Ecuador)Order of Ismail, Grand Cordon with Star (Egypt)Order of Solomon, Knight Grand Cross with Cordon (Ethiopia)Order of the Queen of Sheba, Member (Ethiopia)Legion of Honor, Grand Cross (France)Order of Liberation, Companion (France)Military Medal(France)[249]Croix de guerrew/ palm (France)Royal Order of George I, Knight Grand Cross with Swords (Greece)Royal Order of the Savior, Knight Grand Cross (Greece)Cross of Military Merit, First Class (Guatemala)National Order of Honour and Merit, Grand Cross with Gold Badge (Haiti)Order of the Holy Sepulchre, Knight Grand Cross (Holy See)Military Order of Italy, Knight Grand Cross with Swords (Italy)Order of the Chrysanthemum, Collar (Japan)Order of the Oak Crown, Grand Cross (Luxembourg)Luxembourg War Cross(Luxembourg)Order of the Aztec Eagle, Collar (Mexico)Medal of Military Merit(Mexico)Medal of Civic Merit(Mexico)Order of Ouissam Alaouite, Grand Cross (Morocco)Order of the Netherlands Lion, Knight Grand Cross (Netherlands)Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, Grand Cross (Norway)Order of Nishan-e-Pakistan, First Class (Pakistan)Orden Vasco Núñez de Balboa, Grand Cross (Panama)Order of Manuel Amador Guerrero, Grand Collar (Panama)Order of Sikatuna, Grand Collar (Philippines)Legion of Honor, Chief Commander (Philippines)Distinguished Service Star, (Philippines)Order of Polonia Restituta, Grand Cross (Poland)Order of Virtuti Militari, First Class (Poland)Cross of Grunwald, First Class (Poland)Order pro merito Melitensi, Knight Grand Cross (Sovereign Military Order of Malta)Order of the Royal House of Chakri, Knight (Thailand)Order of Nichan Iftikhar, Grand Cordon (Tunisia)Order of the Bath, Knight Grand Cross (United Kingdom)Order of Merit, Member (United Kingdom)Africa Star, with "8" and "1" numerical devices (United Kingdom)Order of Victory, Star (USSR)Order of Suvorov, First Class (USSR)The Royal Yugoslav Commemorative War Cross(Yugoslavia)Other honors[edit]An apartment at the top of theCulzean Castlein Scotland was given to General of the Army Dwight D.
