Monroe was the last president who was aFounding Father of the United Statesand the last president from theVirginian dynastyand theRepublican Generation.[1]Born inWestmoreland County,Virginia, Monroe was of the planter class and fought in theAmerican Revolutionary War. He was wounded in theBattle of Trentonwith a musket ball to his shoulder. After studying law underThomas Jeffersonfrom 1780 to 1783, he served as adelegatein theContinental Congress. As ananti-federalistdelegate to the Virginia convention that considered ratification of theUnited States Constitution, Monroe opposedratification, claiming it gave too much power to the central government. He took an active part in the new government, and in 1790 he was elected to theSenateofthe first United States Congress, where he joined theJeffersonians. He gained experience as an executive as theGovernor of Virginiaand rose to national prominence as a diplomat in France, when he helped negotiate theLouisiana Purchasein 1803. During theWar of 1812, Monroe held the critical roles ofSecretary of Stateand theSecretary of Warunder PresidentJames Madison.[2]Facing little opposition from the fracturedFederalist Party, Monroe waseasily electedpresident in 1816, winning over 80 percent of the electoral vote and becoming the last president during theFirst Party Systemera of American politics. As president, hebought Florida from Spainand sought to ease partisan tensions, embarking on a tour of the country that was generally well received. With the ratification of theTreaty of 1818, under the successful diplomacy of his Secretary of StateJohn Quincy Adams, the United States extended from theAtlanticto thePacific, giving America harbor and fishing rights in thePacific Northwest. The United States and Britain jointly occupied theOregon Country. In addition to the acquisition of Florida, the landmarkTreaty of 1819secured the border of the United States along the42nd Parallelto the Pacific Ocean and represented America's first determined attempt at creating an "American global empire".[3]As nationalism surged, partisan fury subsided and the "Era of Good Feelings" ensued until thePanic of 1819struck anddispute over the admission of Missouriembroiled the country in 1820. Nonetheless, Monroewon near-unanimous reelection.Monroe supported the founding ofcolonies in Africa for free African Americansthat would eventually form the nation ofLiberia, whose capital,Monrovia, is named in his honor. In 1823, he announced the United States' opposition to any European intervention in therecently independent countriesof theAmericaswith theMonroe Doctrine, which became a landmark in American foreign policy. His presidency concluded the first period of American presidential history before the beginning ofJacksonian democracyand theSecond Party Systemera. Following his retirement in 1825, Monroe was plagued by financial difficulties. He died inNew York Cityon July 4, 1831.Contents1Early life1.1Education1.2Military service in the Revolutionary War and serious wounding2Marriage and family3Plantations and slavery4Early political career4.1Virginia politics4.2Ambassador to France5Governor of Virginia and diplomat5.11808 election and the Quids6Secretary of State and Secretary of War7Presidential elections of 1816 and 18208Presidency8.1Domestic politics8.1.1Democratic-Republican Party dominance8.1.2Domestic troubles8.1.3Cumberland Road8.1.4Indigenous American policies8.2Foreign policy8.2.1Spanish Florida8.2.2Monroe Doctrine8.3Administration and Cabinet8.4Judicial appointments8.5States admitted to the Union9Post-presidency10Death11Religious beliefs12Slavery13Honors and memberships14Legacy and memory15See also16Notes17References18Bibliography19External linksEarly life[edit]Marker designating the site of James Monroe's birthplace inMonroe Hall, VirginiaJames Monroe was born on April 28, 1758, in his parents' house located in a wooded area of Westmoreland County,Virginia. The site is marked and is one mile from the unincorporated community known today asMonroe Hall, Virginia. TheJames Monroe Family Home Sitewas listed on theNational Register of Historic Placesin 1979.[4]His father Spence Monroe (1727&ndash;1774) was a moderately prosperous planter who also practiced carpentry. His mother Elizabeth Jones (1730&ndash;1774) married Spence Monroe in 1752 and they had several children.[5]His paternal great-grandfather Patrick Andrew Monroe emigrated to America from Scotland in the mid-17th century. In 1650 he patented a large tract of land in Washington Parish,Westmoreland County, Virginia. Among James Monroe's ancestors wereFrench Huguenotimmigrants, who came to Virginia in 1700.[5]Education[edit]First tutored at home by his mother Elizabeth, between the ages of 11 and 16, the young Monroe studied at Campbell town Academy, a school run by Reverend Archibald Campbell of Washington Parish. There he excelled as a pupil and progressed through Latin and mathematics faster than most boys his age.John Marshall, laterChief Justice of the United States, was among his classmates.Upon the death of his father in 1774, Monroe inherited his smallplantationand slaves, officially joining the ruling class of the planter elite in what had become the slave society of Virginia.[6]Sixteen years old, he began forming a close relationship with his maternal uncle, the influentialJudge Joseph Jones, who had been educated at theInns of Courtin London and was the executor of his father's estate. That same year, Monroe enrolled in theCollege of William and Mary. At the time, most students were charged with excitement over the prospect of rebellion againstKing George III.Military service in the Revolutionary War and serious wounding[edit]Battle of Trentonand Hessian guns seized by Virginians led by CaptainWilliam Washingtonand Lt. Monroe who were severely woundedIn early 1776, about a year and a half after his enrollment, Monroe dropped out of college and joined the 3rd Virginia Regiment (established December 28, 1775) in theContinental Armywhere his background as a college student and the son of a well-known planter enabled him to obtain an officer's commission. He never returned to earn a degree.[7]In June 1775, after the battles of Lexington and Concord, Monroe, and some other William and Mary students joined 24 older men in raiding the arsenal at theGovernor's Palacein Williamsburg. They used the loot of 200 muskets and 300 swords to arm the Williamsburgmilitia.AlthoughAndrew Jacksonserved as a courier in a militia unit at age thirteen, Monroe is regarded as the last U.S. President who was aRevolutionary Warveteran, since he served as an officer of the Continental Army and took part in combat.[8]With the rest of Washington's army, Monroe's regiment was chased off Long Island in the fall of 1776 and down the length of New Jersey crossing the Delaware River in December 1776. Down to mere days before their enlistments expired, the Army's commander, GeneralWashingtondecided that only a bold step could save the Army and the revolutionary cause from oblivion. Washington ordered his force, that had shrunk 90% since theBattle of Brooklynwhich is also known by the wider name,Battle of Long Island, and down to under 3,000 effective soldiers, to cross the Delaware River on Christmas Day 1776 in theBattle of Trenton. Monroe and his regiment crossed over and marched through aNor'eastersnow storm north and then east towards Trenton. Along the way, the soldiers were spotted by a young patriot doctor, John Riker, whose dogs had been awakened in the pre-dawn early morning. Riker volunteered to lend his medical bag to the efforts saying that as many doctors as possible would be needed fearing severe casualties from a clash with the battle-tested German-speaking Hessian professional mercenary soldiers. Avoiding detection, the Americans approached the center of Trenton from north and south. When the Hessians sounded the alarm, they tried to get several of their artillery pieces in action to pour grapeshot into the Americans marching down towards the homes they had commandeered. Knowing that this would slow the assault, after a volley of artillery fire, Lieutenant Monroe and General Washington's cousin, Captain William Washington and their men rushed to seize the guns before they could fire. Both young officers were severely wounded. Captain Washington was badly wounded in both hands, and young Lieutenant James Monroe was carried from the field bleeding badly after he was struck in the left shoulder by a musket ball, which severed an artery. It would be the young volunteer doctor, John Riker who clamped the artery, keeping him from bleeding to death and saving the life of a man who would go on to achieve so much in politics both as a Virginian and on the national stage as a future President.[9]The wounded soldier, Monroe was sent home to Virginia to nurse his injuries. The Battle of Trenton would be Monroe's only battle as he would spend the next three months recuperating from his wound. InJohn Trumbull's paintingCapture of theHessiansat the Battle of Trenton, Monroe can be seen lying wounded at left center of the painting. In the famous painting,Washington Crossing the Delaware, Monroe is depicted holding the American flag.[10]After recuperating from his wound, he was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia, and tasked to recruit and lead a regiment, but the regiment was never raised. He returned to Williamsburg in September of 1779 and studied law withGeorge Wythe, and then moved to Richmond to study law with Thomas Jefferson. In 1780 the British invaded Richmond, and asGovernor, Jefferson commissioned Monroe as a colonel to command the militia raised in response and act as liaison to the Continental Army in North Carolina.[11][12]Monroe resumed studying law underJefferson, and continued until 1783.[13][14]Monroe was not particularly interested in legal theory or practice, but chose to take it up because he thought that it offered "the most immediate rewards" and could ease his path to wealth, social standing, and political influence.[14]After passing the bar, he practiced law inFredericksburg, Virginia.[15]Marriage and family[edit]James Monroe marriedElizabeth Kortright(1768&ndash;1830),[16]daughter of Laurence Kortright and Hannah Aspinwall Kortright, on February 16, 1786, in New York City. He had met her while serving with the Continental Congress, which then met in New York, the temporary capital of the new nation. After a brief honeymoon onLong Island, New York, the Monroes returned to New York City to live with her father until Congress adjourned. The Monroes had the following children:Eliza Kortright Monroe Hay (1786&ndash;1840): Eliza was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1786, and was educated in Paris at the school ofMadame Campanduring the time her father was the United States Ambassador to France. In 1808 she marriedGeorge Hay, a prominent Virginia attorney who had served as prosecutor in the trial ofAaron Burrand later U.S. District Judge. Their daughter, Hortense, was named in honor of her childhood friend,Hortense de Beauharnais, step-daughter of Napoleon. Eliza alienated most of Washington society for her refusal to call on wives of the diplomatic corps, as was the custom, and caused another social furor in closing her sister's wedding to all but family and friends. For all her apparent vanity, however, she demonstrated genuine compassion during the fever epidemic that swept Washington during her father's Presidency. She spent many sleepless nights selflessly caring for victims. Following the deaths of her husband and father, Eliza moved to Paris, France, where she died on January 27, 1840.[17]James Spence Monroe (1799&ndash;1801) &ndash; his grave reads "J.S. Monroe", so the proper names are speculative but typical of naming patterns of the time, which passed on family names.Maria Hester Monroe (1804&ndash;1850) &ndash; married her cousinSamuel L. Gouverneuron March 8, 1820, in the first wedding of a president's child in the White House.[18][19]Plantations and slavery[edit]Oak Hill MansionMonroe sold his small inherited Virginia plantation in 1783 to enter law and politics. Monroe later fulfilled his youthful dream of becoming the owner of a largeplantationand wielding great political power, but his plantation was never profitable. Although he owned much more land and slaves and speculated in property, he was rarely on-site to oversee the operations. Overseers treated the slaves harshly to force production, but the plantations barely broke even. Monroe incurred debts by his lavish and expensive lifestyle and often sold property (including slaves) to pay them off.[20]Monroe was a wealthyLoudoun Countyplantation owner who owned numerous slave plantations includingOak HillinAldie.[21]Monroe was an absentee slaveholder in that he had his overseers run the plantations while he lived elsewhere.[21]Overseers moved or separated slave families from different Monroe plantations in accordance with production and maintenance needs of each satellite plantation.[21]One of Monroe's slaves named Daniel often ran away from Monroe's plantation inAlbermarle County, to visit other slaves or separated family members.[22]Monroe commonly referred to Daniel as a "scoundrel" and described the "worthlessness" of Daniel as a runaway slave.[22]Monroe's practice of moving and separating slave families was common treatment of slaves in the South.[22]Early political career[edit]Virginia politics[edit]Monroe was elected to theVirginia House of Delegatesin 1782. He was elected to Congress in November 1783 and served in Annapolis until Congress left for Trenton in June 1784. He had served a total of three years when he finally retired from that office by the rule of rotation.[23]By that time, the government was meeting in the temporary capital ofNew York City.In Virginia, the struggle in 1788 over the ratification of the proposed Constitution involved more than a simple clash between federalists and anti-federalists. Virginians held a full spectrum of opinions about the merits of the proposed change in national government.George WashingtonandJames Madisonwere leading supporters;Patrick HenryandGeorge Masonwere leading opponents. Those who held the middle ground in the ideological struggle became the central figures. Led by Monroe andEdmund Pendleton, these "federalists who are for amendments," criticized the absence of abill of rightsand worried about surrendering taxation powers to the central government. Virginia ratified the Constitution in June 1788, largely because Monroe, Pendleton and followers suspended their reservations and vowed to press for changes after the new government had been established.[24]Virginia narrowly ratified the Constitution. Monroe ran for a House seat in theFirst Congressbut was defeated by Madison. In 1790 he was elected by the Virginia legislature asUnited States Senator. He soon joined the"Democratic-Republican" factionled by Jefferson and Madison, and by 1791 was the party leader in the Senate.[25]Ambassador to France[edit]The earliest preserved portrait of James Monroe as Minister Plenipotentiary to France in 1794.Monroe resigned his Senate seat after being appointedMinister to Francein 1794.[26]As ambassador, Monroe secured the release ofThomas Painein revolutionary France after his arrest for opposition to the execution ofLouis XVI. The government insisted that Paine be deported to the United States.[27]Monroe arranged to free all the Americans held in French prisons. He also gained the freedom ofAdrienne de La Fayetteand issued her and her family American passports (they had been grantedcitizenshipby the U.S. government for contributions during the Revolution.) She used that for travel to herhusband, imprisoned inOlmutz.[28]A strong friend of theFrench Revolution, Monroe tried to assure France thatGeorge Washington's policy of strict neutrality did not favor Britain. But American policy had come to favor Britain, and Monroe was stunned by the United States' signing of theJay Treatyin London. With France and Britain at war, the Jay Treaty alarmed and angered the French. Washington had differences with Monroe and discharged him as Minister to France, claiming his "inefficiency, disruptive maneuvers, and failure to safeguard the interests of his country."[29]Monroe had long been concerned about foreign influence on the presidency. He was alarmed by the Spanish diplomatDon Diego de Gardoqui, who in 1785 tried to convince Congress to allow Spain to close theMississippi Riverto American traffic for 30 years. Spain controlled much of the Mississippi since taking over former French territory, including the important port of New Orleans. Monroe thought that Spain could have endangered the U.S. retention of its Southwest and caused the dominance of the Northeast.[30]Monroe believed in both a strong presidency and the system of checks and balances.In the 1790s he fretted over an aging George Washington being too much influenced by close advisers such asAlexander Hamilton, whom Monroe thought too close to Britain. He was humiliated by Washington's criticism for his support of revolutionary France as minister to the nation.[31]Governor of Virginia and diplomat[edit]Out of office, Monroe returned to practicing law inVirginiauntil electedgovernorthere as a Democratic-Republican, his first term serving from 1799 to 1802. He was reelected Virginia's governor in 1811.[32]He called out the state militia to suppressGabriel's Rebellion. Gabriel and 26 other enslaved people who participated were all hanged for treason. Monroe thought that foreign and Federalist elements had created theQuasi Warof 1798&ndash;1800 and were behind efforts to prevent the election ofThomas Jeffersonas president in 1800. As governor he considered using the Virginia militia to force the outcome in favor of Jefferson.[33]Federalists were likewise suspicious of Monroe, some seeing him as at best a French dupe and at worst a traitor.[34]President Jefferson sent Monroe to France to assistRobert R. Livingstonin negotiating theLouisiana Purchase. Monroe was then appointedMinister to the Court of St. James'sin London from 1803 to 1807. In 1806 he negotiated a treaty with Great Britain, known as theMonroe&ndash;Pinkney Treaty. It would have extended theJay Treatyof 1794 which had expired after ten years. Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 1794&ndash;95 because he felt it would allow the British to subvertAmerican republicanism. The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still hostile. When Monroe and the British signed a renewal in December 1806, Jefferson decided not to even submit it to the Senate for ratification. Although the new treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees that would have been good for business, Jefferson refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain and was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice ofimpressmentof American sailors. Jefferson did not attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward theWar of 1812.[35]After the failure of the treaty, Monroe returned to the United States in 1807. Monroe was deeply hurt by the administration's repudiation of the treaty, and Monroe fell out with Secretary of State James Madison.[36]1808 election and the Quids[edit]The Democratic-Republican Party was increasingly factionalized, with "Old Republicans" or "Quids" denouncing the Jefferson administration for abandoning true republican principles. The Quids, seeing that Monroe's foreign policy had been rejected by Jefferson, tried to enlist Monroe in their cause. The plan was to run Monroe for president in the 1808 election in cooperation with theFederalist Party, which had a strong base in New England.John Randolph of Roanokeled the Quid effort to stop Jefferson's choice ofJames Madison. However, the regular Democratic-Republicans overcame the Quids in the nominating caucus, kept control of the party in Virginia, and protected Madison's base. Monroe was not a candidate for president, and Madison was elected.[37]After the election Monroe quickly reconciled with Jefferson, but did not speak with Madison, a former friend, until 1810.[36]Secretary of State and Secretary of War[edit]Monroe returned to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was elected to another term as governor in 1811, but only served four months. In April 1811, Madison appointed Monroe as Secretary of State in hopes of shoring up the support of the more radical factions of the Democratic-Republicans.[36]Monroe had little to do with theWar of 1812, as President Madison and the War Hawks in Congress were dominant. The war went very badly, and when the British burned theU.S. Capitoland theWhite Houseon August 24, 1814, Madison removed John Armstrong as Secretary of War and turned to Monroe for help, appointing himSecretary of Waron September 27.[38]Monroe resigned as Secretary of State on October 1, but no successor was ever appointed and thus from October 1, 1814 to February 28, 1815, Monroe effectively held both Cabinet posts. Monroe formulated plans for an offensive invasion ofCanadato win the war, but a peace treaty was ratified in February 1815, before any armies moved north. Monroe therefore resigned as Secretary of War on March 15, 1815 and was formally reappointed Secretary of State. Monroe stayed on at State until March 4, 1817, when he began his term as the new President of the United States.[2]Presidential elections of 1816 and 1820[edit]Main articles:United States presidential election, 1816andUnited States presidential election, 1820TheCongressionalnominating caucus experienced little opposition during the administrations of Jefferson and Madison, but this situation changed in the election year of 1816. An indeterminate number of anti-Virginia Republicans, led by the New York delegation, objected to the caucus system along with the Federalists. Disorganization and failure to agree onWilliam H. Crawford,Daniel Tompkins,Henry Clayor another possible contender weakened opposition to Monroe. The boycott by Virginia delegates of the March 12 caucus removed the chances of Monroe's opponents, and he received the caucus nomination four days later.[39]With theFederalist Partyin disarray due to the unpopularity of their opposition to theWar of 1812, Monroe easily won election.[40]The Federalists did not even name a candidate, thoughRufus Kingof New York did run in opposition to Monroe under the Federalist banner.[40]King carried only Connecticut, Delaware, and Massachusetts and won only 34 of 217 electoral votes cast.[40]The collapse of the Federalists left Monroe with no organized opposition at the end of his first term, and he ran for reelection unopposed,[40]the only president other thanWashingtonto do so. A single elector from New Hampshire cast a vote forJohn Quincy Adams, preventing a unanimous vote in theElectoral College.[40]Presidency[edit]File:MONROE, James-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpgBEPengraved portrait of Monroe as President.Domestic politics[edit]Democratic-Republican Party dominance[edit]Monroe largely ignored old party lines in making appointments to lower posts, which reduced political tensions and enabled the "Era of Good Feelings", which lasted through his administration. He made two long national tours in 1817 to build national trust. Frequent stops on these tours allowed innumerable ceremonies of welcome and expressions of good will. TheFederalist Partycontinued to fade away during his administration; it maintained its vitality and organizational integrity in Delaware and a few localities, but lacked influence in national politics. Lacking serious opposition, theDemocratic-Republican Party's Congressional caucus stopped meeting, and for practical purposes the Democratic-Republican Party stopped operating.[41]Domestic troubles[edit]Monroe's popularity remained undiminished even when he followed difficult nationalist policies at a time when the country's commitment to nationalism started to show serious fractures.[citation needed]ThePanic of 1819caused a painful economic depression. The application for statehood in 1819 by theMissouri Territoryas aslave statefailed. An amended bill for gradually eliminating slavery inMissouriprecipitated two years of bitter debate in Congress. TheMissouri Compromisebill of 1820 resolved the struggle, pairing Missouri as a slave state withMaine, a free state, and barring slavery north of latitude 36/30' N forever. The Missouri Compromise lasted until 1854, when Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed it. In 1857 Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney held that it had always been unconstitutional, as part of theDred Scottdecision.Cumberland Road[edit]Congress demanded high subsidies for internal improvements, such as for the improvement of theCumberland Road, during Monroe's presidency.[42]Monroe vetoed theCumberland Road Bill, which provided for yearly improvements to the road, because he believed it to be unconstitutional for the government to have such a large hand in what was essentially a civics bill deserving of attention on a state by state basis. This defiance underlined Monroe's populist ideals and added credit to the local offices that he was so fond of visiting on his speech tours.[43]Indigenous American policies[edit]Main article:Seminole WarsMonroe sparked a constitutional controversy when, in 1817, he sent GeneralAndrew Jacksonto move against Spanish Florida to pursue hostileSeminole Indiansand punish the Spanish for aiding them. News of Jackson's exploits ignited a congressional investigation of the 1st Seminole War. Dominated by Democratic-Republicans, the 15th Congress was generally expansionist and more likely to support the popular Jackson. Ulterior political agendas of many congressmen dismantled partisan and sectional coalitions, so that Jackson's opponents argued weakly and became easily discredited. After much debate, the House of Representatives voted down all resolutions that condemned Jackson in any way, thus implicitly endorsing Monroe's actions and leaving the issue surrounding the role of the executive with respect to war powers unanswered.[44]Monroe believed that the Indians must progress from the hunting stage to become an agricultural people, noting in 1817, "A hunter or savage state requires a greater extent of territory to sustain it than is compatible with progress and just claims of civilised life."[45]His proposals to speed up the assimilation process were ignored by Congress.[46]Foreign policy[edit]Spanish Florida[edit]Relations with Spain over the purchase ofSpanish Floridaproved to be troublesome, especially afterAndrew Jacksoninvaded that territory on what he believed to be the president's authorization, which Monroe later denied giving. But largely through the skillful work of John Quincy Adams, atreatywas signed with Spain in 1819 that ceded Florida to the United States in return for the assumption of $5,000,000 (about $92,592,593 in 2014 dollars) in claims and the relinquishment of any claims to Texas.[47]Florida was ceded to the U.S. in 1821.Monroe Doctrine[edit]Main article:Monroe DoctrineAfter the Napoleonic wars (which ended in 1815), almost all of Spain's and Portugal's colonies in Latin America revolted and declared independence. Americans welcomed this development as a validation of the spirit ofRepublicanism. Secretary of StateJohn Quincy Adamssuggested delaying formal recognition until Florida was secured. The problem of imperial invasion was intensified by a Russian claim to the Pacific coast down to the fifty-first parallel and simultaneous European pressure to have all of Latin America returned to its colonial status.[citation needed]Monroe informed Congress in March 1822 that permanent stable governments had been established in theUnited Provinces of the Río de la Plata(the core of present-dayArgentina),Chile,Peru,ColombiaandMexico. Adams, under Monroe's supervision, wrote the instructions for the ministers (ambassadors) to these new countries. They declared that the policy of the United States was to uphold republican institutions and to seek treaties of commerce on a most-favored-nation basis. The United States would support inter-American congresses dedicated to the development of economic and political institutions fundamentally differing from those prevailing in Europe. The articulation of an "American system" distinct from that of Europe was a basic tenet of Monroe's policy toward Latin America. Monroe took pride as the United States was the first nation to extend recognition and to set an example to the rest of the world for its support of the "cause of liberty and humanity".[citation needed]Monroe formally announced in his message to Congress on December 2, 1823, what was later called theMonroe Doctrine. He proclaimed that the Americas should be free from future European colonization and free from European interference in sovereign countries' affairs. It further stated the United States' intention to stay neutral in European wars and wars between European powers and their colonies, but to consider new colonies or interference with independent countries in the Americas as hostile acts toward the United States.[citation needed]Although it is Monroe's most famous contribution to history, the speech was written by Adams, who designed the doctrine in cooperation with Britain.[48]Monroe and Adams realized that American recognition would not protect the new countries against military intervention to restore Spain's power. In October 1823,Richard Rush, the American minister in London, advised that Foreign SecretaryGeorge Canningwas proposing that the U.S. and Britain jointly declare their opposition to European intervention. Britain, with its powerful navy, also opposed re-conquest ofLatin Americaand suggested that the United States join in proclaiming a "hands off" policy. Galvanized by the British initiative, Monroe consulted with American leaders and then formulated a plan with Adams. Ex-Presidents Jefferson and Madison counseled Monroe to accept the offer, but Adams advised, "It would be more candid ... to avow our principles explicitly to Russia and France, than to come in as a cock-boat in the wake of the British man-of-war." Monroe accepted Adams' advice. Not only must Latin America be left alone, he warned, but also Russia must not encroach southward on the Pacific coast. "...the American continents," he stated, "by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European Power."[citation needed]The Monroe Doctrine at the time of its adoption thus pertained more to the Russians in North America than to the former Spanish colonies. The result was a system of American isolationism under the sponsorship of the British navy. The Monroe Doctrine held that the United States considered the Western Hemisphere as no longer a place for European colonization; that any future effort to gain further political control in the hemisphere or to violate the independence of existing states would be treated as an act of hostility; and finally that there existed two different and incompatible political systems in the world. The United States, therefore, promised to refrain from intervention in European affairs and demanded Europe to abstain from interfering with American matters. There were few serious European attempts at intervention.[48]Administration and Cabinet[edit]Monroe made balanced Cabinet choices, naming a southerner,John C. Calhoun, as Secretary of War, and a northerner,John Quincy Adams, as Secretary of State. Both proved outstanding, as Adams was a master diplomat[49]and Calhoun completely reorganized the War Department to overcome the serious deficiencies that had hobbled it during the War of 1812.[50]Monroe decided on political grounds not to offerHenry Claythe State Department, and Clay turned down the War Department and remained Speaker of the House, so Monroe lacked an outstanding westerner in his cabinet.The Monroe CabinetOfficeNameTermPresidentJames Monroe1817&ndash;1825Vice PresidentDaniel D.

He had operated the family farm from 1788 to 1817, but sold it in the first year of his presidency to the new college. He served on the college's Board of Visitors under Jefferson and under the second rectorJames Madison, both former presidents, almost until his death.Monroe had racked up many debts during his years of public life. He sold off his Highland Plantation (now calledAsh Lawn-Highland). It is now owned by hisalma mater, theCollege of William and Mary, which has opened it to the public as an historic site. Throughout his life, he was not financially solvent, and his wife's poor health made matters worse.[51]He and his wife lived inOak Hill, Virginia, until Elizabeth's death on September 23, 1830. In August 1825, the Monroes had received theMarquis de Lafayetteand PresidentJohn Quincy Adamsas guests there.[52]Death[edit]Monroe's grave at Hollywood Cemetery.John Tyler's grave is visible in the background.Upon Elizabeth's death in 1830, Monroe moved toNew York Cityto live with his daughter Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur who had marriedSamuel L. Gouverneurin the White House. Monroe's health began to slowly fail by the end of the 1820s and John Quincy Adams visited him there in April 1831.[53]Adams found him alert and eager to discuss the situation in Europe, but in ill health. Adams cut the visit short when he thought he was tiring Monroe.Monroe died there fromheart failureandtuberculosison July 4, 1831, thus becoming the third president to have died onIndependence Day, July 4. His death came 55 years after theU.S. Declaration of Independencewas proclaimed and 5 years after the death of two other Founding Fathers who became Presidents:John AdamsandThomas Jefferson. Monroe was originally buried in New York at the Gouverneur family's vault in theNew York City Marble Cemetery. Twenty-seven years later, in 1858, the body was re-interred to the President's Circle at theHollywood CemeteryinRichmond, Virginia. TheJames Monroe Tombis a U.S.National Historic Landmark.Religious beliefs[edit]"When it comes to Monroe's thoughts on religion," Bliss Isely notes, "less is known than that of any other President." No letters survive in which he discussed his religious beliefs. Nor did his friends, family or associates comment on his beliefs. Letters that do survive, such as ones written after the death of his son, contain no discussion of religion.[54]Monroe was raised in a family that belonged to theChurch of Englandwhen it was the state church in Virginia before the Revolution. As an adult, he frequently attendedEpiscopalchurches, though there is no record he ever took communion.[citation needed]Some historians see "deistic tendencies" in his few references to an impersonal God.[55]Unlike Jefferson, Monroe was rarely attacked as an atheist or infidel. In 1832James Renwick Willson, aReformed Presbyterianminister in Albany, New York, criticized Monroe for having "lived and died like a second-rate Athenian philosopher."[56]As Secretary of State, Monroe dismissedMordecai Manuel Noahin 1815 from his post as consul toTunisbecause he was Jewish.[57]Noah protested and gained letters from Adams, Jefferson, and Madison supporting church-state separation and tolerance for Jews.[58]Monroe may have believed in an interactive God for he said:"If we persevere...we can not fail, under the favor of a gracious Providence...My ferventprayersto the Almighty that He will be graciously pleased to continue to us that protection which He has already so conspicuously displayed in our favor."[59]Slavery[edit]Monroe owned dozens ofslaves. According to William Seale, he took several slaves with him to Washington to serve at the White House from 1817 to 1825. This was typical of other slaveholders, as Congress did not provide for domestic staff of the presidents at that time.[60]On October 15, 1799, as someslave traderstried to transport a group of slaves from Southampton to Georgia, theslaves revoltedand killed the traders.[61]According to Scheer's article on the subject, a nearby slave patrol responded and killed ten slaves on the spot in extrajudicial killings without the benefit of trial. Of the initial group, the patrol took five slaves alive. They were tried in an oyer and terminer court without the benefit of a jury,[62]and four were convicted. (The fifth pleadedbenefit of clergyand was flogged and branded). Governor Monroe postponed the slaves' executions to check their identities; he granted a pardon to one, and allowed two to hang. The fourth died in jail from exposure to the cold. Scheer says that Monroe "help[ed] secure a modicum of civil protection for slaves sentenced to death for capital crimes."[63]When Monroe was Governor of Virginia in 1800, hundreds of slaves from Virginia planned to kidnap him, takeRichmond, and negotiate for their freedom. Due to a storm on August 30, they were unable to attack. What became known asGabriel's slave conspiracybecame public knowledge.[64]In response, Governor Monroe called out the militia; the slave patrols soon captured some slaves accused of involvement. Sidbury says some trials had a few measures to prevent abuses, such as an appointed attorney, but they were "hardly 'fair'".Slave codesprevented slaves from being treated like whites, and they were given quick trials without a jury.[65]Monroe influenced the Executive Council to pardon and sell some slaves instead of hanging them.[66]Historians say the Virginia courts executed between 26 and 35 slaves. None of the executed slaves had killed any whites because the uprising had been foiled before it began.[61]As president of Virginia's constitutional convention in the fall of 1829, Monroe reiterated his belief that slavery was a blight which, even as a British colony, Virginia had attempted to eradicate. "What was the origin of our slave population?" he rhetorically asked. "The evil commenced when we were in our Colonial state, but acts were passed by our Colonial Legislature, prohibiting the importation, of more slaves, into the Colony. These were rejected by the Crown." To the dismay of states' rights proponents, he was willing to accept the federal government's financial assistance to emancipate and transport freed slaves to other countries. At the convention, Monroe made his final public statement on slavery, proposing that Virginiaemancipateand deport its bondsmen with "the aid of the Union."[67]Monroe was part of theAmerican Colonization Societyformed in 1816, the members of which includedHenry ClayandAndrew Jackson. They found common ground with some abolitionists in supporting colonization. They helped send several thousand freed slaves to the new colony ofLiberiain Africa from 1820 to 1840. Slave owners like Monroe and Jackson wanted to prevent free blacks from encouraging slaves in the South to rebel. With about $100,000 in Federal grant money, the organization also bought land for the freedmen in what is today Liberia.[68]The capital ofLiberiawas namedMonroviaafter President Monroe.[69]Honors and memberships[edit]Monroe was elected a member of theAmerican Antiquarian Societyin April 1818.[70]Legacy and memory[edit]This sectionis in a list format that may be better presented usingprose.You can help by converting this section to prose, ifappropriate.Editing helpis available.(January 2014)Since its 1824 renaming in his honor, the capital city of the West African country ofLiberiahas been namedMonrovia. It is the only non-American capital city named after a U.S. President.On December 12, 1954, theUnited States Postal Servicereleased a 5˘Liberty Issuepostage stamphonoring Monroe.There are academic buildings named after him at theUniversity of Mary Washington,College of William and Mary,George Mason University, andGeorge Washington University. In addition, a statue of Monroe was dedicated in front of Tucker Hall on the campus of William &amp; Mary in 2015.[71]The City ofMonroe, Michiganis also named for him.Monroe County, Kentucky,[72]established in 1820, was named for him, as wasMonroe County, New York, (1821) andMonroe County, Pennsylvania(1836)Monroe County, West Virginia(1799)[73]andMonroe County, IndianaThe City ofMonroe, Georgia, incorporated in 1821, is named for him.TheTownship of Monroe, in central New Jersey, founded in 1838, bears his name as well.Monroe was the last U.S. President to wear apowdered wig tied in a queue, atricorne hatandknee-breechesaccording to theold-fashioned style of the 18th century.[74][75]That earned him the nickname "The Last Cocked Hat".[76]Monroe is the last president neither to have been photographed nor to have had a photographed predecessor: his portraits are preserved today only on paintings.[77]Monroe was the third consecutive President elected to two consecutive terms, which would not occur again until2012.$100silver certificatedepicting Monroe&#160;Presidential Dollar of James Monroe&#160;First Monroe Postage stamp, Issue of 1904&#160;Statue of Monroe atAsh Lawn-Highland&#160;Monroe Hall at theUniversity of Virginia; Monroe once owned the land on which the university sits.&#160;See also[edit]Book: Presidents of the United States (1789&ndash;1860)Biography portalAdams&ndash;Onís TreatyList of Presidents of the United StatesList of Presidents of the United States, sortable by previous experienceList of slave ownersList of United States political appointments that crossed party linesMonroviaU.S. Presidents on U.S. postage stampsHistory of Virginia on stampsNotes[edit]^Harlow Unger,James Monroe: The Last Founding Father(2009).^abHart, Gary, 'James Monroe' (2005), p. 68^Weeks, William Earl (1992).John Quincy Adams and American Global Empire.
