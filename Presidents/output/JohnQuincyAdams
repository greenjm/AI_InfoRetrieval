He also served as a diplomat, a Senator and member of the House of Representatives. He was a member of theFederalist,Democratic-Republican,National Republican, and laterAnti-MasonicandWhigparties.In his biography,Samuel Flagg Bemisargues that Adams was able to: "gather together, formulate, and practice the fundamentals of American foreign-policy &ndash; self-determination, independence, noncolonization, nonintervention, nonentanglement in European politics, Freedom of the Seas, [and] freedom of commerce."[4]John Quincy Adams was the son of former PresidentJohn AdamsandAbigail Adams. As a diplomat, Adams played an important role in negotiating key treaties, most notably theTreaty of Ghent, which ended theWar of 1812. AsSecretary of State, henegotiated with Britainover the United States' northern border with Canada, negotiated with Spain theannexation of Florida, and drafted theMonroe Doctrine. Historians agree he was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history.[5][6]As president he sought tomodernize the American economyand promote education. Adams enacted a part of his agenda and paid off much of thenational debt.[7]However he was stymied time and again by a Congress controlled by his enemies, and his lack of patronage networks helped politicians eager to undercut him. He lost his1828 bid for re-electiontoAndrew Jackson.Adams is best known as a diplomat who shaped America's foreign policy in line with his ardently nationalist commitment toAmerica's republican values. More recently, he has been portrayed as the exemplar and moral leader in an era of modernization. During Adams' lifetime, technological innovations and new means of communication spread messages of religious revival, social reform, and party politics. Goods, money, and people traveled more rapidly and efficiently than ever before.[8]Adams was elected asU.S. RepresentativefromMassachusettsafter leaving office, serving for the last 17 years of his life with far greater acclaim than he had achieved as president. Animated byhis growing revulsion against slavery,[9]Adams became a leading opponent of theSlave Power. He predicted that if a civil war were to break out, the president could abolish slavery by using hispowers. Adams also predicted the Union's dissolution over the slavery issue, but said that if the South became independent there would be a series of bloody slave revolts.[10]Contents1Early life, education, and early career2Early political career (1796&ndash;1817)2.1Washington administration2.2Massachusetts politics2.3Harvard professor2.4First U.S. minister to Russia2.4.1Diplomatic relations2.4.2Adams in Russian society2.5Minister to the court of St. James's3U.S. Secretary of State (1817&ndash;1825)41824 presidential election5Presidency (1825&ndash;1829)5.1Domestic policies5.2Foreign policies5.3Administration and cabinet5.4Appointments5.4.1Supreme Court5.5States admitted to the Union5.6Departure61828 presidential election7Later congressional career (1830&ndash;1848)7.1Committee assignments7.2Slavery7.3Photography7.4Living Bridge between American Revolution and Civil War7.5Nullification crisis7.6Advancement of science7.7Death8Personal life9Legacy9.1Diaries9.2Personality9.3Antislavery advocacy9.4Film and television10See also11Pronunciation note12Notes13Further reading14Bibliography: works by Adams15External linksEarly life, education, and early career[edit]John Quincy Adams was born on July 11, 1767, toJohn Adamsand his wifeAbigail Adams(née Smith) in a part ofBraintree, Massachusettsthat is nowQuincy.[11]John Quincy Adams did not attend school, but was tutored by his cousin James Thax and his father's law clerk, Nathan Rice.[12]He was named for his mother's maternal grandfather,Colonel John Quincy, after whomQuincy, Massachusetts, is named.[13]His namesake great-grandfather died only two days after he was born.Adams first learned of theDeclaration of Independencefrom the letters his father wrote his mother from theSecond Continental CongressinPhiladelphia. In 1779, Adams began a diary that he kept until just before he died in 1848.[14]The massive fifty volumes are one of the most extensive collections of first-hand information from the period of the early republic and are widely cited by modern historians.[7]Much of Adams' youth was spent accompanying his father overseas. John Adams served as anAmerican envoy to Francefrom 1778 until 1779 and to theNetherlandsfrom 1780 until 1782, and the younger Adams accompanied his father on these diplomatic missions.[7]Adams acquired an education at institutions such asLeiden University. He matriculated in Leiden January 10, 1781.[15][16]For nearly three years, beginning at the age of 14, he accompaniedFrancis Danaas a secretary on a mission toSaint Petersburg,Russia, to obtain recognition of the new United States. He spent time inFinland,Sweden, andDenmarkand, in 1804, published a travel report ofSilesia.[17]During these years overseas, Adamsbecame fluent inFrench and Dutch and became familiar with German and other European languages. Adams, mainly through the influence of his father, had also excelled in classical studies and reached high fluency of Latin and Greek. Upon entering Harvard he had already translated Virgil, Horace, Plutarch, and Aristotle.[18]He enteredHarvard Collegeand was graduated in 1787 with aBachelor of Artsdegree,Phi Beta Kappa.[19]Adams Houseat Harvard College is named in honor of Adams and his father. He later earned anM.A.from Harvard in 1790.[20]Heapprenticedas an attorney withTheophilus ParsonsinNewburyport, Massachusetts, from 1787 to 1789. Hegained admittance to the barin 1791 and beganpracticing lawinBoston.[7]Early political career (1796&ndash;1817)[edit]Washington administration[edit]John Quincy Adams - Age 29Adams first won national recognition when he published a series of widely read articles supporting Washington's decision to keep America out of the growing hostilities surrounding theFrench Revolution. Soon after,George Washingtonappointed Adamsminister to the Netherlands(at the age of 26) in 1793. He did not want the position, preferring to maintain his quiet life of reading in Massachusetts, and probably would have rejected it if his father had not persuaded him to take it. On his way to the Netherlands, he was to deliver a set of documents toJohn Jay, who was negotiating theJay Treaty. After spending some time with Jay, Adams wrote home to his father, in support of the emerging treaty because he thought America should stay out of European affairs. HistorianPaul Nagelhas noted that this letter reached Washington, and that parts of it were used by Washington when drafting hisfarewell address.[7]While going back and forth between The Hague and London, he met and proposed to his future wife,Louisa Catherine Johnson. Though he wanted to return to private life at the end of his appointment, Washington appointed himminister to Portugalin 1796, where he was soon appointed to the Berlin Legation. Though his talents were far greater than his desire to serve, he was finally convinced to remain in public service when he learned how highly Washington thought of his abilities.[7]Gilbert StuartPortrait ofLouisa Catherine JohnsonWashington called Adams "the most valuable of America's officials abroad," and Nagel believes that it was at this time that Adams first came to terms with a lifetime of public service.[7]He became a Fellow of theAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciencesin 1797.[21]When the elder Adams became president, he appointed his son in 1797 asMinister to Prussiaat Washington's urging. There Adams signed the renewal of the very liberal Prussian-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce after negotiations with Prussian Foreign MinisterCount Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein. He served at that post until 1801.While serving abroad, in 1797 Adams also married Louisa Catherine Johnson, the daughter of a poor American merchant, in a ceremony at the church ofAll Hallows-by-the-Tower,London. Adams remains the only president to have married a First Lady born outside of the United States.Massachusetts politics[edit]On his return to the United States, Adams was appointed a Commissioner of Monetary Affairs in Boston by a Federal District Judge; however,Thomas Jeffersonrescinded this appointment. He again tried his hand as an attorney, but shortly afterward entered politics. John Quincy Adams was elected a member of the Massachusetts State Senate in April 1802. In November 1802 he ran as a Federalist for theUnited States House of Representativesand lost.[22]TheMassachusetts General Courtelected Adams as a Federalist to the U.S. Senate soon after, and he served from March 4, 1803, until 1808, when he broke with the Federalist Party. Adams, as a senator, had supported the Louisiana Purchase and Jefferson's Embargo Act, actions which made him very unpopular with Massachusetts Federalists. The Federalist-controlled Massachusetts Legislature chose a replacement for Adams on June 3, 1808, several months early. On June 8, Adams broke with the Federalists, resigned his Senate seat, and became a Republican.[23]Harvard professor[edit]While a member of the Senate, Adams also served as a professor of logic atBrown University.[24]Disowned by the Federalists and not fully accepted by theRepublicans, Adams used his Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard as a new base.[25]Adams' devotion to classical rhetoric shaped his response to public issues. He remained inspired by classical rhetorical ideals long after the neo-classicalism and deferential politics of the founding generation had been eclipsed by the commercial ethos and mass democracy of the Jacksonian Era. Many of Adams' idiosyncratic positions were rooted in his abiding devotion to the Ciceronian ideal of the citizen-orator "speaking well" to promote the welfare of the polis.[26]Adams was influenced by the classical republican ideal of civic eloquence espoused by British philosopherDavid Hume.[27]Adams adapted these classical republican ideals of public oratory to America, viewing the multilevel political structure as ripe for "the renaissance of Demosthenic eloquence." Adams'Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory(1810) looks at the fate of ancient oratory, the necessity of liberty for it to flourish, and its importance as a unifying element for a new nation of diverse cultures and beliefs. Just as civic eloquence failed to gain popularity in Britain, in the United States interest faded in the second decade of the 19th century as the "public spheres of heated oratory" disappeared in favor of the private sphere.[28]First U.S. minister to Russia[edit]PresidentJames Madisonappointed Adams as the first everUnited States Minister to Russiain 1809 (thoughFrancis DanaandWilliam Shorthad previously been nominated to the post, neither presented his credentials atSaint Petersburg). After resigning his post at Harvard, Adams and his wife Louisa boarded a merchant ship in Boston on Aug. 5, 1809. Their youngest son was with them during the long and tedious voyage to St. Petersburg. Their voyage was temporarily interrupted outside the southern coast of Norway[29]due to theGunboat War. They were at first boarded by a British officer who examined their papers and then, later that day, by aNorwegianofficer who ordered the ship toChristiansand. In Christiansand, Adams discovered thirty-eight U.S. vessels which had been detained by theNorwegiansand decided to take whatever action necessary to gain the release of both ships and crew as soon as possible.Norwaywas underDanishrule at the time, so the officer and pirates were actuallyNorwegian. The voyage to St. Petersburg resumed but was once again stopped by a British squadron. Adams showed his commission toAdmiral Albermarle Bertie, the commander of the Squadron who recognized the usage of nations and Adams as an ambassador. The usage of nations is common laws of nations founded on custom. Because of the many delays, the Adams' did not arrive in St. Petersburg until October 23, 1809.Diplomatic relations[edit]CountNikolay Rumyantsev, Chancellor of the empire, formally received Adams, and requested a copy of his credential letter. Romanzoff assured Adams that his appointment pleased him personally. Adams presentation to the emperor was postponed however because of the temporary indisposition ofAlexander I. Rumyantsev immediately invited Adams to a diplomatic dinner which included the French ambassador,Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, Duke of Vicenza, numerous foreign ministers then at the Russian Court, and many of the nobility. This was the same mansion Adams had dined in 1781, as secretary of Francis Dana.Tsar Alexander I received Adams alone in his cabinet where he expressed his pleasure at Adams' appointment. Adams told Alexander that "the President of the United States had desired him to express the hope that his mission would be considered as a proof of respect for the person and character of his majesty, as an acknowledgment of the many testimonies of good-will he had already given to the United States, and of a desire to strengthen commercial relations between them and his provinces." Alexander replied, that, "in everything depending on him, he should be happy to contribute to the increase of their friendly relations; that it was his wish to establish a just system of maritime rights, and that he should adhere invariably to those he had declared."[30]After these official diplomatic greetings, Alexander and Adams discussed several other issues such as the policies of the different European powers, trade and commerce, and other mutually beneficial prospects, and that the Russian and U.S. could be very useful to each other.Adams was also given private audiences with the empress and the dowager empress, who also received Louisa Adams. While not officially a diplomat, Louisa Adams did serve an invaluable role as wife-of-diplomat, becoming a favorite of the czar and making up for her husband's utter lack of charm. She was an indispensable part of the American mission.[31]Adams requested Rumyantsev to ask Alexander to act on behalf of the United States in securing the release of the American sailors and ships being held by the Danish. The Tsar ordered the Chancellor to request the release of the American property as soon as possible, which the Danish government complied with. Adams spent a great deal of time securing the release of American vessels and seamen from various "seizures and sequestrations."In 1811, Adams received a commission from the Secretary of State as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Adams immediately declined and remained in St. Petersburg. In 1812, Adams reported the news ofNapoleon's invasion of Russiaand Napoleon's disastrous retreat. Also in 1812, Rumyantsev asked if he should request Alexander to mediate a pacification of hostilities between the United States and Great Britain. The U.S. accepted the offer and in July 1813, two associates of Adams,Albert GallatinandJames A. Bayardarrived in St. Petersburg to begin negotiations under mediation by Alexander. Gallatin was at that time Secretary of Treasury and the Senate rejected his appointment to the diplomatic mission as incompatible under the Constitution. However, this rejection did not occur until after Gallatin and Bayard had already left for St. Petersburg. In September,Lord William Cathcartdelivered a British memoir to Alexander explaining their reasons for declining the mediation. Thus ended President Madison's hope that Alexander could end the war.[32]Adams in Russian society[edit]Adams was well liked by the Russian Court and often would be met on walks by Alexander. The tsar asked Adams if he would be taking a house in the country over the summer. When Adams hesitated, the emperor stated with good humor that perhaps it was a financial consideration and Adams was able to respond in kind that it was in large part. Adams was a man who endeavored to live within the means provided by the American government.[33]The Adams' were also provided with several invitations to various entertainments. "The formalities of these court presentations," Mr. Adams remarked, "are so trifling and insignificant in themselves, and so important in the eyes of princes and courtiers, that they are much more embarrassing to an American than business of greater importance. It is not safe or prudent to despise them, nor practicable for a person of rational understanding to value them."[34]Adams was concerned that the various balls and parties given by the Tsar and the foreign ministers, took too much time away from his official duties. Often these events would last until 4 a.m., so Adams stopped attending those he was able to avoid. The numerous diplomatic visits also annoyed Adams who wrote "I have been engaged the whole forenoon; and though I rise at six o'clock, I am sometimes unable to find time to write only part of a private letter in the course of the day. These visits take up so much of my time, that I sometimes think of taking a resolution not to receive them; but, on the other hand, so much information important to be possessed, and particularly relative to current political events, is to be collected from them, that they are rather to be encouraged than discountenanced."In 1814, Adams was recalled from Russia to serve as chief negotiator of the U.S. commission for theTreaty of Ghent, which ended theWar of 1812between the United States and United Kingdom.Minister to the court of St. James's[edit]Finally, he was sent to beminister to the Court of St. James's(Britain) from 1815 until 1817, a post that was first held by his father.[23]The name is derived from its location atSt. James's Palace. In London, Adams was part of a U.S. Legation consisting of himself, two young secretaries and a small office in Craven Street, London WC2.[35]Since they were not particularly well paid, Adams and his wife Louisa lived inEaling, at that time a village in the countryside, in order to maintain the expensive carriages and liveries which social appearance demanded.[35]1815 US passport issued by John Quincy Adams at LondonU.S. Secretary of State (1817&ndash;1825)[edit]John Quincy Adams byGilbert Stuart, 1818Adams served asSecretary of Statein theCabinetof PresidentJames Monroefrom 1817 until 1825. Typically, his views concurred with those espoused by Monroe. As Secretary of State, he negotiated theAdams&ndash;Onís Treaty(which acquiredFloridafor the United States), theTreaty of 1818, and wrote theMonroe Doctrine. Many historians regard him as one of the greatest Secretaries of State in American history.[5][6]The Floridas, still a Spanish territory but with no Spanish presence to speak of, became a refuge for runaway slaves and native Americans. Monroe sent in GeneralAndrew Jacksonwho pushed the Seminole south, executed two British merchants who were supplying weapons, deposed one governor and named another, and left an American garrison in occupation.[36]President Monroe and all his cabinet, except Adams, believed Jackson had exceeded his instructions. Adams argued that since Spain had proved incapable of policing her territories, the United States was obliged to act in self-defense. Adams so ably justified Jackson's conduct that he silenced protests from either Spain or Britain; Congress refused to punish Jackson. Adams used the events that had unfolded in Florida to negotiate the Florida Treaty with Spain in 1819 that turned Florida over to the U.S. and resolved border issues regarding the Louisiana Purchase.[36]With the ongoingOregon boundary dispute, Adams sought to negotiate a settlement with England to decide the border between the western United States and Canada. This would become theTreaty of 1818. Along with theRush&ndash;Bagot Treatyof 1817, this marked the beginning of improved relations between the British Empire and its former colonies, and paved the way for better relations between the U.S. andCanada. The treaty had several provisions, but in particular it set the boundary betweenBritish North Americaand the United States along the49th parallelthrough theRocky Mountains. This settled a boundary dispute caused by ignorance of actual geography in the boundary agreed to in the 1783Treaty of Paristhat ended theAmerican Revolutionary War. That earlier treaty had used theMississippi Riverto determine the border, but assumed that the river extended further north than it did, and so that earlier settlement was unworkable.By the time Monroe became president, several European powers, in particular Spain, were attempting to re-establish control over South America.[37]OnIndependence Day1821, in response to those who advocated American support for independence movements in many South American countries,[38]Adams gave a speech in which he said that American policy was moral support for independence movements but not armed intervention. Adams foresaw what would befall the United States if it sacrificed its republican spirit on the altar of empire. He stated that America "goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy" lest she "involve herself beyond power of extrication, in all wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom. The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force." The United States, Adams warned, might "become the dictatress of the world [but] she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit."[39]From this, Adams authored what came to be known as the Monroe Doctrine, which was introduced on December 2, 1823. It stated that further efforts byEuropeancountries to colonize land or interfere with states in theAmericaswould be viewed as acts of aggression requiring U.S. intervention.[40]The United States, reflecting concerns raised by Great Britain, ultimately hoped to avoid having any European power take over Spain's colonies.[37]It became a defining moment in theforeign policy of the United Statesand one of its longest-standing tenets, and would be invoked by many U.S. statesmen and several U.S. presidents, includingTheodore Roosevelt,Calvin Coolidge,Herbert Hoover,John F. Kennedy,Ronald Reaganand others.1824 presidential election[edit]1938 stampof John Quincy AdamsAs the1824 electiondrew near people began looking for candidates. New England voters admired Adams' patriotism and political skills and it was mainly due to their support that he entered the race. The old caucus system of theDemocratic-Republican Partyhad collapsed; indeed the entireFirst Party Systemhad collapsed and the election was a fight based on regional support. Adams had a strong base in New England. His opponents includedJohn C. Calhoun,William H. Crawford,Henry Clay, and the hero of New Orleans,Andrew Jackson. During the campaign Calhoun dropped out, and Crawford fell ill giving further support to the other candidates. When Election Day arrived, Andrew Jackson won, although narrowly, pluralities of the popular and electoral votes, but not the necessary majority of electoral votes.[41]With just over one-fourth voter turnout for the election, combined with Adams receiving less than one-third of the popular vote, Adams scored only 113,142 votes.File:ADAMS, John Q-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpgBEPengraved portrait of Adams as presidentUnder the terms of theTwelfth Amendment, the presidential election fell to the House of Representatives, which was to choose from the top three candidates: Jackson, Adams, and Crawford. Clay had come in fourth place and thus was not on the ballot, but he retained considerable power and influence as Speaker of the House.Clay's personal dislike for Jackson and the similarity of hisAmerican Systemto Adams' position ontariffsandinternal improvementscaused him to throw his support to Adams, who was elected by the House on February 9, 1825, on the first ballot. Adams' victory shocked Jackson, who had won the most electoral and popular votes and fully expected to be elected president. When Adams appointed Clay as Secretary of State&mdash;the position that Adams and his three predecessors had held before becoming president&mdash;Jacksonian Democratswere outraged, and claimed that Adams and Clay had struck a "corrupt bargain". This contention overshadowed Adams' term and greatly contributed to Adams' loss to Jackson four years later, in the1828 election.[41]Presidency (1825&ndash;1829)[edit]John Quincy Adams in a posthumous portrait created in 1858 byG.P.A. Healy.[42]Adams served as the sixthPresident of the United Statesfrom March 4, 1825, to March 4, 1829. He took theoath of officeon abook of constitutional law, instead of the more traditionalBible. Adams proposed an elaborate program ofinternal improvements(roads, ports and canals), a national university, and federal support for the arts and sciences. He favored a high tariff to encourage the building of factories, and restricted land sales to slow the movement west. Opposition from the states' rights faction of a hostile congress killed many of his proposals.[43]He also reduced thenational debtfrom $16 million to $5 million, the remainder of which was paid off by his immediate successor,Andrew Jackson.[7]Paul Nagel argues that his political acumen was not any less developed than others were in his day, and notes thatHenry Clay, one of the era's most astute politicians, was a principal adviser to Adams and supporter throughout his presidency. Nagel argues that Adams' political problems were the result of an unusually hostile Jacksonian faction, and Adams' own dislike of the office.[7]Although a product of the political culture of his day, he refused to play politics according to the usual rules and was not as aggressive in courting political support as he could have been. He was attacked by the followers ofJackson, who accused him of being a partner to a "corrupt bargain" to obtain Clay's support in the election and then appoint himSecretary of State.[44]Jackson defeated Adams in 1828, and created the modernDemocratic partythus inaugurating theSecond Party System.[45]Domestic policies[edit]Presidential Dollarof John Quincy AdamsDuring his term, Adams worked on transforming America into a world power through "internal improvements," as a part of the "American System". It consisted of a high tariff to support internal improvements such as road-building, and a national bank to encourage productive enterprise and form a national currency. In his first annual message to Congress, Adams presented an ambitious program for modernization that included roads, canals, a national university,[46]an astronomical observatory,[47]and other initiatives. The support for his proposals was mixed, mainly due to opposition from Jackson's followers.[48]Some of his proposals were adopted, specifically the extension of theCumberland RoadintoOhiowith surveys for its continuation west toSt. Louis; the beginning of theChesapeake and Ohio Canal, the construction of theChesapeake and Delaware Canaland theLouisville and Portland Canalaround thefalls of the Ohio; the connection of theGreat Lakesto theOhio River systemin Ohio and Indiana; and the enlargement and rebuilding of theDismal Swamp CanalinNorth Carolina.[49]One of the issues which divided the administration was protective tariffs, of which Henry Clay was a leading advocate. After Adams lost control of Congress in 1827, the situation became more complicated. By signing into law theTariff of 1828, quite unpopular in parts of the south, he further antagonized the Jacksonians.[50]Adams' generous policy toward Native Americans caused him trouble. Settlers on the frontier, who were constantly seeking to move westward, cried for a more expansionist policy. When the federal government tried to assert authority on behalf of the Cherokees, the governor of Georgia took up arms. Adams defended his domestic agenda as continuing Monroe's policies. In contrast, Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren instigated the policy of Indian removal to the west (i.e. theTrail of Tears).[51]Foreign policies[edit]Adams is regarded as one of the greatest diplomats in American history, and during his tenure asSecretary of State, he was the chief designer of theMonroe Doctrine.[52]He had witnessed theFirst Barbary Warand theSecond Barbary Waragainst the Arab pirates of North Africa, and theGreek War of Independencefrom the Ottoman Turks. Public opinion in the U.S. strongly favored the Greek cause and such leaders asHenry Claycalled for intervention. Adams strongly opposed any entanglement in European affairs.[53]According to Charles Edel, Adams believed that, "Intervention would accomplish little, retard the cause of republicanism, and distract the country from its primary goal of continental expansion". Moreover, fearful that U.S. intentions would outstrip its capabilities, Adams thought that projecting U.S. power abroad would weaken its gravitational force on the North American continent.[54]On July 4, 1821, he gave an address to Congress:... But she [the United States of America] goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.[39]During his term as president, however, Adams achieved little of long-term consequence in foreign affairs. A reason for this was the opposition he faced in Congress, where his rivals prevented him from succeeding.[52]Among his diplomatic achievements were treaties ofreciprocitywith a number of nations, includingDenmark,Mexico, theHanseatic League, theScandinaviancountries,PrussiaandAustria. However, thanks to the successes of Adams' diplomacy during his previous eight years as secretary of state, most of the foreign policy issues he would have faced had been resolved by the time he became president.[55]Administration and cabinet[edit]The Adams CabinetOfficeNameTermPresidentJohn Quincy Adams1825&ndash;1829Vice PresidentJohn C.

Adams did not attend the inauguration of his successor, Andrew Jackson, who had openly snubbed him by refusing to pay the traditional "courtesy call" to the outgoing president during the weeks before his own inauguration.[7]He was one of only four presidents who chose not to attend their respective successor's inauguration; the others werehis father,Andrew Johnson, and Richard Nixon.1828 presidential election[edit]Main article:United States presidential election, 1828After the inauguration of Adams in 1825, Jackson resigned from his senate seat. For four years he worked hard, with help from his supporters in Congress, to defeat Adams in thepresidential election of 1828. The campaign was very much a personal one. As was the tradition of the day and age in American presidential politics, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press. This reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wifeRachelof bigamy. She died a few weeks after the elections. Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who had attacked his wife.Adams lost the election by a decisive margin. He won all the same states that his father had won in theelection of 1800: the New England states,New Jersey, andDelaware, as well as parts of New York and a majority of Maryland. Jackson won the rest of the states, picking up 178 electoral votes to Adams' 83 votes, and succeeded him. Adams and his father were the only U.S. presidents to serve a single term during the first 48 years of the Presidency (1789&ndash;1837). HistorianThomas Baileyobserved, "Seldom has the public mind been so successfully poisoned against an honest and high-minded man."[56]Later congressional career (1830&ndash;1848)[edit]Adams did not retire after leaving office. Instead he ran for and won a seat in theUnited States House of Representativesin the1830 elections. This went against the generally held opinion that former Presidents should not run for public office. He was the first President to serve inCongressafter his term of office, and one of only two former presidents to do so (Andrew Johnsonlater served in theSenate). He was elected to nine terms, serving as a Representative for 17 years, from 1831 until his death.Adams ran for Governor of Massachusetts in 1833 on theAnti-Masonicticket.[57]IncumbentNational RepublicanGovernorLevi Lincoln Jr.was retiring and Adams faced National RepublicanJohn Davis, DemocratMarcus Mortonand Samuel L. Allen of theWorking Men's Party. Davis won a plurality, 40%, and Adams took 29% with Morton taking 25% and Allen 6%. Because no candidate had won a majority, the election was sent to the state legislature to decide. Adams withdrew and endorsed Davis, preferring him over Morton, and Davis was chosen by the legislature in January 1834.In authoring a change to theTariff of 1828, he was instrumental to the compromise that ended theNullification Crisis. WhenJames Smithsondied and left his estate to the U.S. government to build an institution of learning, many in Congress wanted to use the money for other purposes. Adams was key to ensuring that the money was instead used to build theSmithsonian Institution.[7]Committee assignments[edit]In Congress, he was chair of theCommittee on Commerce and Manufactures, theCommittee on Indian Affairsand theCommittee on Foreign Affairs.[58]Slavery[edit]Main article:John Quincy Adams and abolitionismA longtime opponent of slavery, Adams used his new role in Congress to fight it. In 1836, Southern Representatives voted in a "gag rule" that immediately tabled any petitions about slavery, thus preventing any discussion or debate of the slavery issue. He became a forceful opponent of this rule and conceived a way around it, attacking slavery in the House for two weeks.[7]The gag rule prevented him from bringing slavery petitions to the floor, but he brought one anyway. It was a petition from a Georgia citizen urging disunion due to the continuation of slavery in the South. Though he certainly did not support it and made that clear at the time, his intent was to antagonize the pro-slavery faction of Congress into an open fight on the matter.[7]The plan worked.The petition infuriated his Congressional enemies, many of whom were agitating for disunion themselves. They moved for his censure over the matter, enabling Adams to discuss slavery openly during his subsequent defense. Taking advantage of his right to defend himself, Adams delivered prepared and impromptu remarks against slavery and in favor of abolition.[7]Knowing that he would probably be acquitted, he changed the focus from his own actions to those of the slaveholders, speaking against the slave trade and the ownership of slaves.[59]He decided that if he were censured, he would merely resign, run for the office again, and probably win easily.[7]When his opponents realized that they played into his political strategy, they tried to bury the censure. Adams made sure this did not happen, and the debate continued. He attacked slavery and slaveholders as immoral and condemned the institution while calling for it to end.[7]After two weeks, a vote was held, and he was not censured. He delighted in the misery he was inflicting on the slaveholders he so hated, and prided himself on being "obnoxious to the slave faction."[7]Although the censure of Adams over the slavery petition was ultimately abandoned, the House did address the issue of petitions from enslaved persons at a later time. Adams again argued that the right to petition was a universal right, granted by God, so that those in the weakest positions might always have recourse to those in the most powerful. Adams also called into question the actions of a House that would limit its own ability to debate and resolve questions internally. After this debate, the gag rule was ultimately retained.[60]The discussion ignited by his actions and the attempts of others to quiet him raised questions of the right to petition, the right to legislative debate, and the morality of slavery.[7]During the censure debate, Adams said that he took delight in the fact that southerners would forever remember him as "the acutest, the astutest, the archest enemy of southern slavery that ever existed".[7]In 1844, he chaired a committee for reform of the rules of Congress, and he used this opportunity to try once again to repeal the gag rule. He spent two months building support for this move, but due to northern opposition, the rule narrowly survived.[7]He fiercely criticized northern Representatives and Senators, in particularStephen A. Douglas, who seemed to cater to the slave faction in exchange for southern support.[7]His opposition to slavery made him, along withHenry Clay, one of the leading opponents of Texas annexation and theMexican&ndash;American War. He correctly predicted that both would contribute tocivil war.[7]After one of his reelection victories, he said that he must "bring about a day prophesied when slavery and war shall be banished from the face of the earth."[7]He wrote in his private journal in 1820:[61]The discussion of thisMissouri questionhas betrayed the secret of their souls. In the abstract they admit that slavery is an evil, they disclaim it, and cast it all upon the shoulder of&hellip;Great Britain. But when probed to the quick upon it, they show at the bottom of their souls pride and vainglory in their condition of masterdom. They look down upon the simplicity of a Yankee&rsquo;s manners, because he has no habits of overbearing like theirs and cannot treat negroes like dogs. It is among the evils of slavery that it taints the very sources of moral principle. It establishes false estimates of virtue and vice: for what can be more false and heartless than this doctrine which makes the first and holiest rights of humanity to depend upon the color of the skin?In 1841, at the request ofLewis TappanandEllis Gray, Adams joined the case ofUnited States v. The Amistad. Adams went before theSupreme Courton behalf of African slaves who had revolted and seized the Spanish shipAmistad. Adams appeared on 24 February 1841, and spoke for four hours. His argument succeeded; the Court ruled in favor of the Africans, who were declared free and returned to their homes.[62]Photography[edit]Glass collodion negative copyc. 1860 of adaguerreotypeof John Quincy Adams in 1847 or 1848, attributed toMathew Brady(retouched)In 1843, Adams sat for the earliest confirmed photograph still in existence of a U.S. president, although other sources contend thatWilliam Henry Harrisonhad posed even earlier for his portrait, in 1841.[63]The originaldaguerreotypeis in the collection of theNational Portrait Galleryof theSmithsonian Institution.[64]Living Bridge between American Revolution and Civil War[edit]Although there is no indication that the two were close, Adams metAbraham Lincolnduring the latter's sole term as a member of the House of Representatives, from 1847 until Adams' death.[65]Thus, it has been suggested that Adams is the only major figure in American history who knew both theFounding Fathersand Abraham Lincoln, though Martin Van Buren met Founding FathersThomas JeffersonandJohn Adams, knew FounderAaron Burr(Van Buren's mentor), and met the young Lincoln while on a campaign trip through Illinois.[66]Nullification crisis[edit]Besides his opposition to slavery and thegag rule(discussed above), his congressional career is remembered for several other key accomplishments. Shortly after Adams entered Congress, theNullification Crisisthreatened civil war over theTariff of 1828. Adams authored an alteration to the tariff, which weakened it and diffused the crisis. Congress also passed theForce Billwhich authorized PresidentAndrew Jacksonto use military force if Adams' compromise bill did not force the belligerent states to capitulate. There was no need, however, because Adams' compromise defused the issue. The compromise actually did not alter the tariff as much as the southern states had hoped, though they agreed not to continue pursuing the issue for fear of civil war.[7]Detail view of the portrait ofAdamsin theU.S. National Portrait Gallery,Washington, D.C., painted byGeorge Caleb Bingham; this copy c. 1850 from an original of 1844Advancement of science[edit]Adams also became a leading force for the advancement of science. As president, he had proposed a national observatory, which did not win much support. In 1829 British scientistJames Smithsondied, and left his fortune for the "increase and diffusion of knowledge." In Smithson's will, he stated that should his nephew, Henry James Hungerford, die without heirs, the Smithson estate would go to the government of the United States to create an "Establishment for the increase &amp; diffusion of Knowledge among men." After the nephew died without heirs in 1835, PresidentAndrew JacksoninformedCongressof the bequest, which amounted to aboutUS$500,000 ($75,000,000 in 2008 U.S. dollars after inflation). Adams realized that this might allow the United States to realize his dream of building a national institution of science and learning. Adams thus became Congress' primary supporter of what would become theSmithsonian Institution. He also relentlessly pursued support for astronomical efforts and observatories, seeking a national observatory for the United States.[67][68]His efforts eventually led to what is now the United States' oldest, still-operational scientific institution, theUnited States Naval Observatory. In 1825 Adams signed a bill for the creation of a national observatory just before leaving presidential office &ndash; which became the Naval Observatory. Adams in fact spent many nights at the Observatory, with celebrated national astronomer and oceanographerMatthew Fontaine Maury, watching and charting the stars, which had always been one of Adams' avocations.As for efforts to found theSmithsonian Institution, the money was invested in shaky state bonds, which quickly defaulted. After heated debate in Congress, Adams successfully argued to restore the lost funds with interest.[69]Though Congress wanted to use the money for other purposes, Adams successfully persuaded Congress to preserve the money for an institution of science and learning.[7]Congress also debated whether the federal government had the authority to accept the gift, though with Adams leading the initiative, Congress decided to accept the legacy bequeathed to the nation and pledged the faith of the United States to the charitable trust on July 1, 1836.[70]Death[edit]Adams'scenotaphat the Congressional CemeteryIn 1846, the 78-year-old former president suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed. After a few months of rest, he made a full recovery and resumed his duties in Congress. When Adams entered the House chamber, everyone "stood up and applauded."[71]On February 21, 1848, theHouse of Representativeswas discussing the matter of honoring U.S. Army officers who served in theMexican&ndash;American War. Adams had been a vehement critic of the war, and as Congressmen rose up to say, "Aye!" in favor of the measure, he instead yelled, "No!"[72]He rose to answer a question put forth by the Speaker of the House.[73]Immediately thereafter, Adams collapsed, having suffered a massivecerebral hemorrhage.[74]Two days later, on February 23, he died with his wife and youngest son at his side in the Speaker's Room inside theCapitol BuildinginWashington, D.C.His last words were "This is the last of earth. I am content." He died at 7:20&#160;p.m.[73]His original interment was temporary, in the public vault at theCongressional CemeteryinWashington, D.C.Later, he was interred in the family burial ground in Quincy, Massachusetts, across from the First Parish Church, calledHancock Cemetery. After Louisa's death in 1852, his sonCharles Francis Adamshad his parents reinterred in the expanded family crypt in theUnited First Parish Churchacross the street, next to John and Abigail. Both tombs are viewable by the public. Adams' original tomb at Hancock Cemetery is still there and marked simply "J.Q. Adams".[75]Personal life[edit]John Quincy Adams andLouisa Catherine Adamshad three sons and a daughter. Their daughter, Louisa, was born in 1811 but died in 1812 while the family was in Russia. They named their first sonGeorge Washington Adams(1801&ndash;1829) after the first president. Both George and their second son,John(1803&ndash;1834), led troubled lives and died in early adulthood.[76][77](George committed suicide and John was expelled from Harvard before his 1823 graduation.)John Quincy Adams' original tomb atHancock Cemetery, across the street from United First Parish ChurchAdams' youngest son,Charles Francis Adams(who named his own sonJohn Quincy), also pursued a career in diplomacy and politics. In 1870 Charles Francis built the first memorialpresidential libraryin the United States, to honor his father. The Stone Library includes over 14,000 books written in twelve languages. The library is located in the "Old House" atAdams National Historical ParkinQuincy, Massachusetts.John Adams and John Quincy Adams were the only father and son to serve as presidents untilGeorge H. W. Bush(1989&ndash;1993) andGeorge W. Bush(2001&ndash;2009).Adams has been determined to have the highest I.Q. of any U.S. President.[78][79]Legacy[edit]Tombs of PresidentsJohn Adams(left) and John Quincy Adams (right) and their wives, in a family crypt beneath theUnited First Parish ChurchJohn Quincy Adams Birthplaceis now part ofAdams National Historical Parkand open to the public. The name Quincy has been used for at least nineteen other places in the United States. Those places were either directly or indirectly named for John Quincy Adams (for example,Quincy, Illinois, was named in honor of Adams whileQuincy, California, was named for Quincy, Illinois).Adams was the first president to have his photograph taken.[80]He also became the first president to adopt a short haircut instead of long hair tied in a queue and to regularly wear longtrousersinstead ofknee breeches. He is probably best known as a diplomat who shaped America's foreign policy in accordance with his ardently nationalist views, and is widely considered by historians to have been one of the greatest diplomats in American history.[5]He was key to the negotiation of several important treaties, such as the Treaty of Ghent, which ended theWar of 1812, and the Florida Treaty, which resulted in the annexation ofFlorida. He also formulated theMonroe Doctrine, which is still evoked to the present day. He is viewed by many as the exemplar and moral leader in an era of modernization. During this era, new technologies and networks of infrastructure and communication brought to the people messages of religious revival, social reform, and party politics, as well as moving goods, money, and people ever more rapidly and efficiently.[8]Though he was always quite hostile to slavery, nearly to be point of being anabolitionist(although he doubted the abolitionists could successfully end slavery), he grew even more hostile to it later in life.[9]Adams became a leading opponent of slave power and articulated a theory whereby the president could abolish slavery by using hiswar powers, a correct prediction ofAbraham Lincoln's use of theEmancipation Proclamationin 1863. Adams predicted the likelihood of the Union's dissolution over the slavery issue, and was a key opponent of the Mexican&ndash;American War for this reason.[10]Though he later described his presidency as the unhappiest time of his life,[7]scholars rate John Quincy Adams in the second quartile in the majority ofhistorical presidential rankings.Historians have often included Adams among the leading conservatives of his day.[7][81][82][83][84]Russell Kirk, however, sees Adams as a flawed conservative who was imprudent in opposing slavery.[81]Diaries[edit]One of Adams' most important legacies is his massive diary,[7]which he began at age 11 with the simple entry "A journal, by me, J.Q.A." The Diary, housed at theMassachusetts Historical Society, covers, in extraordinary detail, Adams' life and experiences up to his death in 1848.[14]The massive fifty volumes are one of the most extensive collections of first-hand information from that period of the early American republic, and are cited by historians in a wide range of matters pertaining to that period.[7]Personality[edit]Adams' personality was much like that of his father, as were his political beliefs.[7]Throughout his life, he always preferred reading in seclusion to attending social engagements, and several times had to be pressured by others to remain in public service. Historian Paul Nagel argues that, likeAbraham Lincolnafter him, Adams suffered from depression for much of his life. Early in his life he sought some form of treatment. Adams thought his depression was due to the high expectations demanded of him by his father and mother. Throughout his life he felt inadequate and socially awkward because of his depression, and was constantly bothered by his physical appearance.[7]He was closer to his father, whom he spent much of his early life with abroad, than he was to his mother. When he was younger and the American Revolution was going on, his mother told her children what their father was doing, and what he was risking, and because of this Adams grew to greatly respect his father.[7]His relationship with his mother was rocky; she had high expectations of him and was afraid her children might end up a dead alcoholic like her brother.[7]As Abigail Adams had feared, John Quincy's brother, Charles, would eventually follow this fate.John Quincy fell in love shortly after he finished school, but his mother did not approve of his considering marriage when he was still dependent on his parents for support, and the relationship ended. When he fell in love with his future wife,Louisa Johnson, his mother disapproved of this relationship as well. His biographer, Nagel, concludes that this disapproval motivated him to marry Johnson in 1797, despite Adams' reservations that Johnson, like his mother, had a strong a personality.[7]Marquis de Lafayetteonce gave Adams an alligator as a gift, which he lodged for months in the unfinished East Room of the White House, before building it its own lodge. Reports indicate he enjoyed showing it to visitors.[85][86]Antislavery advocacy[edit]Adams lived at the corner ofTremontandBoylston Streets, Boston, 1806&ndash;1809[87]Before 1820, Adams was best known as an exponent of American nationalism. Later in life, especially after his election to the House, he was famous as the most prominent national leader opposing slavery. He was not an abolitionist, say biographers Nagel and Parsons.[7][88]Remini notes that Adams thought the end of slavery would come by either civil war or the consent of the slave South, but definitely not through the work of abolitionists.[89]The turning point came with the debate on theMissouri Compromisein 1820 when he broke with his friendJohn C. Calhoun, who became the most outspoken national leader in favor of slavery. They became bitter enemies. Adams vilified slavery as a terrible evil and preached total abolition, while Calhoun countered that the right to own slaves had to be protected from interference from the federal government to keep the nation alive. Adams said slavery contradicted the principles ofrepublicanism, while Calhoun said that slavery was essential to American democracy, for it made all white men equal. Both men pulled away from nationalism, and started to consider dissolution of the Union as a way of resolving the slavery predicament. Adams predicted that if the South formed a new nation, it would be torn apart by an extremely violent slave insurrection. If the two nations went to war, Adams predicted the president of the United States would use his war powers to abolish slavery. The two men became ideological leaders of the North and the South.[90]In the House Adams became a champion of free speech, demanding that petitions against slavery be heard despite a "gag rule" that said they could not be heard.[91]John Quincy Adams during his final hours of life after his collapse in the Capitol. Drawing in pencil by Arthur Joseph Stansbury, digitally restored.In 1841, Adams had the case of a lifetime, representing the defendants inUnited States v. The Amistad Africansin theSupreme Court of the United States. He successfully argued that the Africans, who had seized control of a Spanish ship on which they were being transported illegally as slaves, should not be extradited or deported to Cuba (a Spanish colony where slavery was legal) but should be considered free. Under PresidentMartin Van Buren, the government argued the Africans should be deported for having mutinied and killed officers on the ship. Adams won their freedom, with the chance to stay in the United States or return to Africa. Adams made the argument because the U.S. had prohibited the international slave trade, although it allowed internal slavery. He never billed for his services in theAmistadcase.[92]The speech was directed not only at the justices of this Supreme Court hearing the case, but also to the broad national audience he instructed in the evils of slavery.[93]Adams repeatedly spoke out against the "Slave Power", that is the organized political power of the slave owners who dominated all the southern states and their representation in Congress.[94]He vehemently attacked the annexation of Texas (1845) and the Mexican War (1846&ndash;48) as part of a "conspiracy" to extend slavery.[95]Film and television[edit]Adams occasionally is featured in the mass media. In thePBSminiseriesThe Adams Chronicles(1976), he was portrayed byDavid Birney,William Daniels, Marcel Trenchard, Steven Grover and Mark Winkworth. He was also portrayed byAnthony Hopkinsin the 1997 filmAmistad, and again byEbon Moss-Bachrachand Steven Hinkle in the 2008HBOtelevision miniseriesJohn Adams; the HBO series received criticism for needless historical and temporal distortions in its portrayal.[96]Ancestors of John Quincy Adams&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;16.
