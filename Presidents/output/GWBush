The eldest son ofBarbaraandGeorge H. W. Bush, he was born inNew Haven, Connecticut. After graduating fromYale Universityin 1968 andHarvard Business Schoolin 1975, he worked in oil businesses. He marriedLaura Welchin 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for theHouse of Representativesshortly thereafter. He later co-owned theTexas Rangersbaseball team before defeatingAnn Richardsin the1994 Texas gubernatorial election. He was elected president in 2000 after aclose and controversial election, becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than his opponent.[6]He is the second president to have been the son of a former president, the first having beenJohn Quincy Adams.[7]He is also the brother ofJeb Bush, who is a formerGovernor of Floridaand candidate for theRepublicanpresidential nomination in the2016 presidential election.Eight months into Bush's first term as president, theSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacksoccurred. Bush responded bylaunchingthe "War on Terror", an international military campaign which included thewar in Afghanistan, launched in 2001 and thewar in Iraq, launched in 2003. He also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, social security reform, andamendingtheConstitutionto prohibitsame-sex marriage.[8]He signed into lawbroad tax cuts, thePatriot Act, theNo Child Left Behind Act, thePartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act,Medicareprescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for theAIDSrelief program known asPEPFAR. His tenure saw national debates onimmigration,Social Security,electronic surveillance, andtorture.Bush successfully ran for re-election against Democratic SenatorJohn Kerryin2004, in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush received increasingly heatedcriticismfrom across thepolitical spectrum[9][10][11]for his handling of the Iraq War,Hurricane Katrina,[12][13][14]and other challenges. Amid this criticism, theDemocratic Partyregained control of Congress in the2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War IIrecession, often referred to as the "Great Recession," prompting the Bush Administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the2008 financial crisis.[15]He was met with public protests even occurring during visits to the United Kingdom.[16]Bush left office in 2009 and since then, he has returned to Texas and purchased a home in a suburban area ofDallas. He is currently a public speaker, has written amemoirtitledDecision Points,[17]has taken up painting as a hobby, andhis presidential librarywas opened in 2013. His presidency has been ranked among the worst in recentsurveys of presidential scholars.[18][19][20]Contents1Childhood to mid-life1.1Early life and education1.2Texas Air National Guard2Marriage, family, and personal life3Early career, 1978&ndash;954Governor of Texas (1995&ndash;2000)5Presidential campaigns5.12000 presidential candidacy5.1.1Primary5.1.2General election5.22004 presidential candidacy6Presidency (2001&ndash;09)6.1Domestic policy6.1.1Economic policy6.1.2Education and health6.1.3Social services and Social Security6.1.4Environmental policies6.1.5Energy policies6.1.6Stem cell research and first use of veto power6.1.7Genetic Nondiscrimination6.1.8Immigration6.1.9Hurricane Katrina6.1.10Midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys6.2Foreign policy6.2.1September 11 attacks6.2.2War on Terrorism6.2.3Afghanistan invasion6.2.4Iraq invasion6.2.5Surveillance6.2.6Interrogation policies6.2.7North Korea condemnation6.2.8Syria sanctions6.2.9Africa6.2.10Assassination attempt6.2.11Other issues6.3Judicial appointments6.3.1Supreme Court6.3.2Other courts6.4Public image and perception6.4.1Domestic6.4.1.1Image6.4.1.2Job approval6.4.2Foreign perceptions6.4.3Acknowledgments and dedications7Post-presidency (2009&ndash;present)7.1Residence7.2Messages7.3Collaborations7.4Visual art8Legacy9See also10References11Further reading12External linksChildhood to mid-lifeMain article:Early life of George W.

He was raised inMidlandandHouston, Texas, with four siblings,Jeb,Neil,MarvinandDorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died fromleukemiaat the age of three in 1953.[22]His grandfather,Prescott Bush, was a U.S. Senator fromConnecticut.[23]His father George H. W. Bush wasRonald Reagan's Vice President from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. President from 1989 to 1993. Bush hasEnglishand someGermanancestry, along with more distantDutch,Welsh,Irish,French, andScottishroots.[24]Bush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed his 7th grade year. He then went toThe Kinkaid School, aprep schoolin Houston for two years.[25]Bush finished high school at thePhillips Academy, aboarding school(then all-male) inAndover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball and, during his senior year, was the head cheerleader.[26][27]He attendedYale Universityfrom 1964 to 1968, graduating with aB.A.degree inhistory.[28]During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of theDelta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the fraternity's president during his senior year.[29][30][31]Bush became amemberof theSkull and Bonessociety as a senior.[32]Bush was arugby unionplayer and was on Yale's 1st XV.[33]He characterized himself as an average student.[34]His average during his first three years at Yale was 77 and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating system in his final year.[35]Beginning in the fall of 1973, Bush attended theHarvard Business School, where he earned anM.B.A.degree. He is the only U.S. President to have earned an M.B.A.[36]Texas Air National GuardMain article:George W. Bush military service controversySee also:Killian documents controversyandKillian documents authenticity issuesLt. George W. Bush while in theTexas Air National GuardIn May 1968, Bush was commissioned into theTexas Air National Guard.[37]After two years of active-duty service while training,[38]he was assigned to Houston, flyingConvairF-102swith the147th Reconnaissance Wingout of theEllington Field Joint Reserve Base.[37][39]Critics, including formerDemocratic National CommitteeChairmanTerry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of theHouse of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.[40]In June 2005, theUnited States Department of Defensereleased all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.[41]In late 1972 and early 1973, hedrilledwith the187th Fighter Wingof theAlabama Air National Guard, having moved toMontgomery, Alabama, to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of RepublicanWinton M. Blount.[42][43]In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.[44]He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974.[45]Marriage, family, and personal lifeSee also:Bush familyAt a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him toLaura Lane Welch, a school teacher and librarian. Bush proposed to her after a three-month courtship, and they married on November 5 of that year.[46]The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush left his family'sEpiscopal Churchto join his wife'sUnited Methodist Church.[2]On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth tofraternal twindaughters,Barbara Pierce BushandJenna Welch Bush;[46]they graduated from high school in 2000 and fromYale Universityand theUniversity of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004.George andLaura Bushwith their daughtersJennaandBarbara, 1990Prior to his marriage, Bush had multiple episodes of alcohol abuse.[47]In one instance, on September 4, 1976, he was arrested near his family's summer home inKennebunkport, Maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He pleaded guilty, was fined $150 and had his Maine driver's license briefly suspended.[48]Bush says his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,[46]and attributes to her influence his 1986 decision to give up alcohol.[49]While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, "I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time."[46]Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.[50]During his time as president, Bush read theBibledaily.[51]He also read 14Lincoln biographiesand, during the last three years of his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. A reporter recalls seeing "books byJohn Fowles,F. Scott Fitzgerald,James Joyce, andGore Vidallying about, as well as biographies ofWilla CatherandQueen Victoria" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other hobbies include cigar smoking and golf.[52]Since leaving the White House, Bush has also taken up oil painting.[53]His first granddaughter, Margaret Laura "Mila" Hager, was born to his daughterJenna Bushon April 14, 2013. She is named after her two grandmothers.[54]Early career, 1978&ndash;95Main article:Professional life of George W. BushGeorge W. Bush with his father outside the White House, April 29, 1992In 1978, Bush ran for theHouse of RepresentativesfromTexas's 19th congressional district. His opponent,Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans. Bush lost the election by 6,000 votes (6&#160;percent) of the 103,000 votes cast.[55]He returned to the oil industry and began a series of small, independent oil exploration companies.[56]He createdArbusto Energy,[57]and later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the largerSpectrum 7, and Bush became chairman.[56]The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded intoHKN, Inc.[56][58]Bush served on the board of directors for HKN.[56]Questions of possibleinsider tradinginvolving HKN arose, but theSecurities and Exchange Commission's(SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.[56][59]Bush moved his family to Washington, D.C. in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency.[60][61]He served as a campaign adviser and liaison to the media;[56]he assisted his father by campaigning across the country.[56]Returning to Texas after the successful campaign, he purchased a share in theTexas Rangersbaseball franchise in April 1989, where he served as managing general partner for five years.[62]He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans.[63]Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15&#160;million from his initial $800,000 investment.[64]In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 Presidential re-election campaign as "campaign advisor".[65]The prior month, his father asked him to tell White House chief of staffJohn H. Sununuthat he should resign.[66]Governor of Texas (1995&ndash;2000)Main article:Governorship of George W. BushGovernor Bush (right) with father, former presidentGeorge H. W. Bushand wife, Laura, in 1997As Bush's brother, Jeb, sought the governorship of Florida, Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform,tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement.[56]Bush's campaign advisers wereKaren Hughes,Joe Allbaugh, andKarl Rove.[67]After easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent GovernorAnn Richards.[56][68]In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtainpermits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it after he became governor.[69]According toThe Atlantic Monthly, the race "featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record&mdash;when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowedhomosexual activists' to state jobs".[70]The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove,[71]but Rove denied being involved.[72]Bush won the general election with 53.5&#160;percent against Richards' 45.9&#160;percent.[73]Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion.[67]He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reducedomestic violence.[74]Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.[56]In 1999, Bush signed a state law obliging electric retailers to buy acertain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS),[75][76][77]which helpedTexaseventually become theleading producerofwind poweredelectricity in the U.S.[78][79][80]In 1998, Bush won re-election with a record[56]69&#160;percent of the vote.[81]He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.[56]For most of Texas history, governors served two-year terms; aconstitutional amendmentextended those terms to four years starting in 1975.[82]In his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings.[56]He proclaimed June 10, 2000 to beJesus Dayin Texas, a day on which he "urge[d] all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need".[83]Throughout Bush's first term, national attention focused on him as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared.[56]Within a year, he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.Presidential campaigns2000 presidential candidacyMain article:United States presidential election, 2000PrimaryGeorge W. Bush in Concord, New Hampshire signing to be a candidate for presidentIn June 1999, while Governor of Texas, Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States. With no incumbent running, Bush entered a large field of candidates for the Republican Party presidential nomination consisting ofJohn McCain,Alan Keyes,Steve Forbes,Gary Bauer,Orrin Hatch,Elizabeth Dole,Dan Quayle,Pat Buchanan,Lamar Alexander,John Kasich, andRobert C. Smith.Bush portrayed himself as acompassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of theUnited States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.[56]By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.[56]Bush won theIowa caucuses, but, although he was heavily favored to win theNew Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19&#160;percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum and, according to political observers, effectively became the front runner after theSouth Carolina primary, which according toThe Boston Globemade history for his campaign's negativity;The New York Timesdescribed it as asmear campaign.[84][85][86]General electionOn July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers by askingDick Cheney, a formerWhite House Chief of Staff,U.S. Representative, andSecretary of Defense, to be hisrunning mate. Cheney was then serving as head of Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. Soon after, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the2000 Republican National Convention.Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.[56]Bush's campaign criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice PresidentAl Gore, overgun controland taxation.[87]When the election returns came in on November 7, Bush won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to arecount.[56]The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching theU.S. Supreme Court.[88]On December 9, in the controversialBush v. Goreruling,[89]the Court reversed aFlorida Supreme Courtdecision ordering a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated theEqual Protection Clauseof theFourteenth Amendment.[56]The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast.[90]Although he received 543,895 fewer individual votes than Gore nationwide, Bush won the election, receiving 271electoral votesto Gore's 266.[90]2004 presidential candidacyMain article:United States presidential election, 2004George W. Bush speaks at a campaign rally in 2004In 2004, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointedKen Mehlmanas campaign manager, with a political strategy devised byKarl Rove.[91]Bush and the Republican platform included a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,[92]support for theUSA PATRIOT Act,[93]a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion andsame-sex marriage,[92][94]reformingSocial Securityto create private investment accounts,[92]creation of anownership society,[92]and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.[95]Bush also called for the implementation of aguest worker programfor immigrants,[92]which was criticized by conservatives.[96]The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts SenatorJohn Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on theIraq War, and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunchliberalwho would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,[56]and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286electoral votes. He won an outright majority of the popular vote (50.7&#160;percent to his opponent's 48.3&#160;percent).[97]The previous President to win an outright majority of the popular vote was Bush's father in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time sinceHerbert Hoover'selection in 1928that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.Presidency (2001&ndash;09)Main articles:Presidency of George W. Bush,George W. Bush's first term as President of the United StatesandGeorge W. Bush's second term as President of the United StatesPresident Bush addressing the media at the Pentagon, September 17, 2001Though Bush originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, his priorities were significantly altered following theSeptember 11 terrorist attacksin 2001.[98]Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq with significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings[99]steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.[100]In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.[101]Domestic policyMain article:Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administrationEconomic policyMain article:Economic policy of the George W. Bush administrationBush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of theDot-com bubble.[102]The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. The Bush administration increased federalgovernment spendingfrom $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60&#160;percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14&#160;percent, corporate tax revenues by 50&#160;percent, customs and duties by 40&#160;percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107&#160;percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62&#160;percent, Medicare spending by 131&#160;percent, social security by 51&#160;percent, and income security spending by 130&#160;percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35&#160;percent and spending by 65&#160;percent.[103]President Bush signing a $1.35 trilliontax cut into law, June 7, 2001The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor sinceLyndon B. Johnson.[104]The number ofeconomic regulationgovernmental workers increased by 91,196.[105]The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion&mdash;the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.[106]In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6&#160;trillion surplus over the next ten years.[107]Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35&#160;trilliontax cut program&mdash;one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.[56]Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money."[56]Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspanwarned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.[108]Treasury SecretaryPaul O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermineSocial Security.[109]O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's bookDecision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.[110]By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.[56]Another tax cut programwas passed that year.During the 2001 to 2008 years, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125&#160;percent,[111]less than for past business cycles.[112]Bush entered office with theDow Jones Industrial Averageat 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency.[113]Deficitanddebtincreases 2001&ndash;2009. Gross debt has increased over $500 billion each year since FY2003.Unemployment originally rose from 4.2&#160;percent in January 2001 to 6.3&#160;percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5&#160;percent as of July 2007.[114]Adjusted for inflation,median household incomedropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007,[115]while Professor Ken Homa ofGeorgetown Universityhas noted that "Median real after-tax household income went up 2%".[116]The poverty rate increased from 11.3&#160;percent in 2000 to 12.3&#160;percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7&#160;percent in 2004.[117]By October 2008, due to increases in spending,[118]the national debthad risen to $11.3&#160;trillion,[119]an increase of over 100&#160;percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6&#160;trillion.[120][121]Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the "Bush tax cuts" and increased national security spending.[122]In March 2006, then-SenatorBarack Obamasaid when he voted against raising thedebt ceiling: "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure."[123]By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2&#160;percent.[124]In December 2007, the United States entered the longest post&ndash;World War IIrecession,[125]which included ahousing market correction, asubprime mortgage crisis,soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value.[126]In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record.[127][128]To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170&#160;billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation ofFannie MaeandFreddie Macin 2003,[129]and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.[130][131][132]In September 2008,the crisis became much more seriousbeginning with the government takeover ofFannie Mae and Freddie Macfollowed by the collapse ofLehman Brothersand a federal bailout ofAmerican International Groupfor $85&#160;billion.[133]Many economists and world governments determined that the situation became the worst financial crisis since theGreat Depression.[134][135]Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspan.[136]Bush, meanwhile, proposed afinancial rescue planto buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market.[137]Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at theAmerican Enterprise Institute, said "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and theFDICto look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped "for Congress to have held hearings".[131]In November 2008, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years.[138]TheBureau of Labor Statisticsreported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9&#160;million jobs were lost.[139]By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost a total of 2.6&#160;million jobs.[140]Education and healthBush undertook a number of educational priorities, such as increasing the funding for theNational Science FoundationandNational Institutes of Healthin his first years of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.[141]President Bush signing theNo Child Left Behind Actinto law, January 2002One of the administration's early major initiatives was theNo Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of SenatorTed KennedyofMassachusetts.[142]It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[143]Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed "No Child Left Behind" into law.[144]Critics argue that it is underfunded[145]and that NCLBA's focus on "high-stakes testing" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[146]After being re-elected, Bush signed into law aMedicaredrug benefit program that, according toJan Crawford Greenburg, resulted in "the greatest expansion in America'swelfare statein forty years;" the bill's costs approached $7&#160;trillion.[147]In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoedState Children's Health Insurance Program(SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six&#160;million to ten&#160;million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.[148]Bush viewed the legislation as a move towardsocialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.[149]Social services and Social SecurityFollowing Republican efforts to pass theMedicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to theMedicareprogram by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.[150]The retired persons lobby groupAARPworked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400&#160;billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly "better choices and more control over their health care".[151]President Bush discussing Social Security reform at the Lake Nona YMCA Family Center in Orlando, Florida, March 18, 2005Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social Security,[152]which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.[152]In his2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments.[152]Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.[152]Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as "Conversations on Social Security", in an attempt to gain public support.[153]Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined[154]and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.[155]The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the political fallout fromHurricane Katrinain the fall of 2005.[156]After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.Environmental policiesMain article:Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration § EnvironmentUpon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to theKyoto Protocol, an amendment to theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changewhich seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducinggreenhouse gasemissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80&#160;percent of the world's population[157]and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.[158]He also cited that the Senate had voted 95&ndash;0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.President Bush delivering a statement on energy, urging Congress to endoffshore oil drillban, June 18, 2008In May 2001, Bush signed anexecutive orderto create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects,[159]and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.[160]In 2002, Bush announced theClear Skies Act of 2003,[161]aimed at amending theClean Air Actto reduce air pollution through the use ofemissions tradingprograms. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.[162]The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.Bush has said that he believes thatglobal warmingis real[163]and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a "debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused".[164]The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration[165]misinformed the public and did not do enough to reducecarbon emissionsand deter global warming.[166]Energy policiesIn his2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, "America is addicted to oil" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increaseenergy developmentresearch.[167]That same year, Bush declared theNorthwestern Hawaiian Islandsa national monument, creating the largestmarine reserveto date. ThePapah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monumentcomprises 84&#160;million acres (340,000&#160;km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.[168]The move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".[169]President Bush signing theFederal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act, September 26, 2006In his2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducingfossil fuelconsumption and increasingalternative fuelproduction.[170]Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban onoffshore drilling.[171]However, the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress."[171]Bush had said in June 2008, "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogenfuel cells.... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production."[172]In his2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2&#160;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."[173]Stem cell research and first use of veto powerFederal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through theDepartment of Health and Human Servicesand theNational Institutes of Healthhas been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of theDickey-Wicker Amendmentby Congress and the signature of PresidentBill Clinton.[174]Bush has said that he supports adultstem cellresearch and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not supportembryonic stem cellresearch.[175]On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing "lines" of stem cells,[176]but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can only be done on 12 of the original lines, and all of the approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.[177]On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto theStem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.[178]Genetic NondiscriminationOn May 21, 2008 President George W. Bush signed into law theGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act(GINA).[179][180]The bill protects Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.ImmigrationPresident Bush discussing border security with Homeland Security DirectorMichael ChertoffnearEl Paso, November 2005Nearly 8&#160;million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history.[181]Almost half entered illegally.[182]In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12&#160;millionillegal immigrantsto work in the United States with the creation of a "temporary guest-worker program". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000National Guardtroops to theMexico&ndash;United States border.[183]From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported theComprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration.[184]The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of thegreen cardapplication process and the introduction of a point-based "merit" system for green cards; elimination of "chain migration" and of theDiversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor.[185]Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.[186]A heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.[187]The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when acloturemotion failed on a 46&ndash;53 vote.[188]Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.[189]The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.[190]On September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime MinisterEhud Olmertsaid that Bush offered to accept 100,000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.[191]Hurricane KatrinaMain article:Political effects of Hurricane KatrinaPresident Bush shaking hands with New Orleans MayorRay Naginafter viewing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, September 2, 2005Hurricane Katrina, one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history, struck early in Bush's second term. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005Atlantichurricane season and devastated much of the north-centralGulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans.[192]Bush declared a state of emergency inLouisianaon August 27,[193]and inMississippiandAlabamathe following day;[194]he authorized theDepartment of Homeland Security(DHS) andFederal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action.[195]The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due toleveebreaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana,[196]officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.President Bush with hurricane victims in Biloxi, September 2, 2005On August 30, DHS SecretaryMichael Chertoffdeclared it "an incident of national significance",[197]triggering the first use of the newly createdNational Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans.[198]The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana,Mississippi, andAlabamaand declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was "not enough".[199]As the disaster in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notablyMichael D. Brown;[200]it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of theIraq War[201]and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.[202][203][204]Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency.[198]It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.[205]Midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneysMain article:Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversyPresident Bush announcing his nomination of Alberto Gonzales as the next U.S. Attorney General, November 10, 2004During Bush's second term, a controversy arose over theJustice Department'smidterm dismissal of sevenUnited States Attorneys.[206]The White House maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance.[207]Attorney GeneralAlberto Gonzaleslater resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department.[208][209]TheHouse Judiciary Committeeissued subpoenas for advisersHarriet MiersandJosh Boltento testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right ofexecutive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.[210]Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.[211]On July 31, 2008, aUnited States district courtjudge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas.[212]In all, twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included Attorney GeneralAlberto Gonzales[213]and his chief of staffKyle Sampson,[214]Gonzales' liaison to the White HouseMonica Goodling,[215]aide to the presidentKarl Rove[216]and his senior aideSara M. Taylor.[217]In addition, legal counsel to the presidentHarriet Miers[218]and deputy chief of staff to the presidentJoshua Bolten[219]were both found incontempt of Congress.[217]In 2010, the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings,[220]the firings were "inappropriately political", but not criminal. According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.[221]Foreign policyMain article:Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administrationPresident Bush withItalian Prime MinisterSilvio Berlusconiin 2005In July 2001, Bush visitedPope John Paul IIat Castel Gandolfo.[222]During his Presidential campaign, Bush'sforeign policyplatform included support for stronger economic and political relationship withLatin America, especiallyMexico, and a reduction of involvement in "nation-building" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued anational missile defense.[223]Bush was an advocate of China's entry into theWorld Trade Organization.[224]In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to anaxis of evilincludingIraq,IranandNorth Korea.[225]After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalitioninvaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched theinvasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.[226]Those invasions led to the toppling of theTalibanregime in Afghanistan and the removal ofSaddam Husseinfrom power in Iraq.Foreign Minister of IndiaPranab Mukherjeewith President Bush, March 2008Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviserKaren Hughesto oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.[citation needed]In March 2006, a visit to India led to renewed ties between the two countries, reversing decades of U.S. policy.[227]The visit focused particularly on areas ofnuclear energyand counter-terrorism cooperation, discussions that would lead eventually to theU.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement.[228]This is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.[229]Countries visited by President George W. Bush during his terms in officeMidway through Bush's second term, it was questioned whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.[230]In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thankedU.K. Prime MinisterTony Blairfor traveling to Washington to show "unity of purpose with America", and said "America has no truer friend than Great Britain."[231]September 11 attacksMain article:September 11 attacksPresident Bush, standing with firefighterBob Beckwith, addressing rescue workers atGround Zeroin New York, September 14, 2001The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from theOval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. On September 14, he visitedGround Zero, meeting with MayorRudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of rubble, to much applause: "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."[232]President Bush Declares 'Freedom at War with Fear', September 20, 2001Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.Problems playing this file? Seemedia help.In a September 20 speech, Bush condemnedOsama bin Ladenand his organizationAl-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to "hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate".[233]War on TerrorismMain article:War on TerrorPresident Bush presenting former UK Prime MinisterTony Blairwith thePresidential Medal of Freedom, January 13, 2009After September 11, Bush announced a global War on Terror. The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with Osama bin Laden, so Bush ordered theinvasion of Afghanistanto overthrow the Taliban regime.[234]In his January 29,2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an "axis of evil" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq was "arming to threaten the peace of the world" and "pose[d] a grave and growing danger".[235]The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wagepreemptive war, orpreventive war.[236]This became the basis for theBush Doctrinewhich weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks.[237]Dissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.[238][239][240]In 2006, aNational Intelligence Estimateconcluded that the Iraq War had become the "cause célčbreforjihadists".[241][242]Afghanistan invasionMain article:War in Afghanistan (2001&ndash;present)President Bush and PresidentHamid Karzaiof Afghanistan appearing at a joint news conference in Kabul, March 1, 2006On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival ofNorthern Alliancetroops inKabulon November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat theTaliban, driveal-Qaedaout of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,[243]but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[243]Later that month the UN had installed theAfghan Transitional Administrationchaired byHamid Karzai.[244][245]In 2002, based onUNICEFfigures,Nicholas Kristofreported that "our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.[246]Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region ofTora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.[247]It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces. Bin Laden's successor,Ayman al-Zawahiri, as well as the leader of the Taliban,Mohammed Omar, remain at large.Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.[248]The 2005 failure ofOperation Red Wingsshowed that the Taliban had returned.[249]In 2006, theTaliban insurgencyappeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such asOperation Mountain Thrustattaining limited success.[250][251][252]As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.[253]Iraq invasionMain articles:Iraq WarandGeorge W. Bush and the Iraq WarPresident Bush, withNaval Flight OfficerLieutenant Ryan Philips, after landing on the USSAbraham Lincolnprior to hisMission Accomplished speech, May 1, 2003Beginning with his January 29, 2002State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an "axis of evil" allied with terrorists and posing "a grave and growing danger" to U.S. interests through possession ofweapons of mass destruction.[235][254]In the latter half of 2002, CIAreportscontained assertions ofSaddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqibiologicalandchemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions.[255][256]Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.[257][258]In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqidisarmamentmandates, precipitating adiplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix andMohamed ElBaradeiled UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.[259]The U.S. initially sought aUN Security Councilresolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.[260]President Bush paying a surprise visit toBaghdad International Airport, November 27, 2003More than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the "coalition of the willing" joined the United States[261]in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital,Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's "Mission Accomplished" speech was later criticized as premature.[262]From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scalecivil war in Iraq.[263]Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisanIraq Study Group, led byJames Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was "grave and deteriorating". While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq,[264]he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy.[265][266]President Bush with Iraqi Prime MinisterNouri al-Maliki, July 25, 2006In January 2005, free, democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years.[267]According to Iraqi National Security AdvisorMowaffak al-Rubaie, "This is the greatest day in the history of this country."[267]Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis "have taken rightful control of their country's destiny".[267]This led to the election ofJalal Talabanias President andNouri al-Malikias Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by mostShiitesand manyKurds.[268]On January 10, 2007, Bush announced asurge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2&#160;billion for these programs.[269]On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops,[270]saying the debate over the conflict was "understandable" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.[271]In March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's "bold decision" to launch theBattle of Basraagainst theMahdi Army, calling it "a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq".[272]He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding GeneralDavid Petraeusand AmbassadorRyan Crockerabout how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for theIraqi elections.[273]By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began,[274]and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces.[274]SurveillanceFollowing the events of September 11, Bush issued an executive order authorizing thePresident's Surveillance Programwhich included allowing theNSAto monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant as required by theForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[275]As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified.[276]Once theDepartment of JusticeOffice of Legal Counselquestioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of theAuthorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[277]The program proved to becontroversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as theAmerican Bar Association, argued that it was illegal.[278]In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that theNSA electronic surveillance programwas unconstitutional,[279]but on July 6, 2007, that ruling wasvacatedby theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuiton the grounds that the plaintiffs lackedstanding.[280]On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.[281]Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to asPRISM, that was subject to the oversight of theUnited States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.[282]This program was not publicly revealed until reports by theWashington Post[282]andThe Guardian[283]emerged in June 2013.[282]Interrogation policiesSee also:Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torturePresident Bush at the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of victory in World War II,Red Square, MoscowBush authorized theCIAto usewaterboardingas one of severalenhanced interrogation techniques.[284][285][286]Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on a secret Justice Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by theGeneva Conventions' ban on torture and Vice President Cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal.[287][288]The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in theBybee Memofrom the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn.[289]While not permitted by theU.S. Army Field Manualswhich assert "that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information",[287]the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations "provided critical information" to preserve American lives.[290]Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, "you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough."[291]On October 17, 2006, Bush signed into law theMilitary Commissions Act of 2006,[292]a law enacted in the wake of theSupreme Court'sdecision inHamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548U.S.557(2006),[293]which allows the U.S. government to prosecuteunlawful enemy combatantsby military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access tohabeas corpusand bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.[292]On March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082,[294]a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under theUnited States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that "the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror".[295]In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics.[296]One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.[297]North Korea condemnationMain article:North Korea&ndash;United States relationsPresident Bush withChina's President andCommunist partyleaderHu Jintao, 2006Bush publicly condemnedKim Jong-ilof North Korea, naming North Korea one of three states in an "axis of evil", and saying that "the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons."[235]Within months, "both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.-DPRKAgreed Framework of October 1994."[298]North Korea's October 9, 2006,detonationof a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on "[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world".[235]Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to "a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula", and stated that "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States", for which North Korea would be held accountable.[299]On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China.[300]On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.[301]By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea.[302]On June 22, 2010, "While South Korea prospers, the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly," he said, adding that, "communism had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation and brutal suppression. "In recent years," he went on to say, "the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs."[303]Syria sanctionsPresident Bush with Russian presidentVladimir Putinin Shanghai, October 21, 2001Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria.[304]In early 2007, theTreasury Department, acting on a June 2005executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spreadweapons of mass destruction[305]and being supportive of terrorism.[306]Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to "undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004&ndash;2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian PresidentBashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.[307]AfricaBush initiated thePresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS ReliefProgram (PEPFAR). The U.S. government has spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7 billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization),[308]saving an estimated 5 million lives.[309]According toNew York TimescorrespondentPeter Baker, "Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since."[309]Assassination attemptOn May 10, 2005,Vladimir Arutyunian, a nativeGeorgianwho was born to a family of ethnicArmenians, threw a live hand grenade toward a podium where Bush was speaking atFreedom Squarein Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgian PresidentMikheil Saakashviliwas seated nearby. It landed in the crowd about 65 feet (20&#160;m) from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate. Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005, confessed, was convicted and was given alife sentencein January 2006.[310]Other issuesPresident Bush,Mahmoud Abbas, andAriel Sharonmeet at the Red Sea Summit inAqaba, Jordan, June 4, 2003Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including theAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty(ABM) with Russia. He also signed theStrategic Offensive Reductions Treatywith Russia.Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denouncedPalestine Liberation OrganizationleaderYasser Arafatfor his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime MinisterAriel Sharonand Palestinian National Authority PresidentMahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.President Bush and Ukrainian Prime MinisterYulia Tymoshenko, April 1, 2008Bush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over theHainan Island incident, when anEP-3E Aries IIsurveillance aircraft collided with aPeople's Liberation Army Air Forcejet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned themilitia attacks Darfurand denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide.[311]Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to theInternational Criminal Court.In his State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, thePresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Bush announced $15&#160;billion for this effort[312]which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide.[313]On June 10, 2007, he met with Albanian Prime MinisterSali Berishaand became the first president to visit Albania.[314]Bush has voiced his support for theindependenceof Kosovo.[315]Bush opposedSouth Ossetia's independence.[316]On August 15, 2008, Bush said of Russia's invasion of the country ofGeorgia: "Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century."[317]Bush opened the2002 Winter Olympicsin Salt Lake City. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: "On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games."[318]In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended theSummer Olympicsin Beijing.[319]Bush twice invokedSection 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which allows a President to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the Vice President who then becomesActing President. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice PresidentDick Cheneythe Acting President. The medical procedure began at 7:09&#160;a.m. EDT and ended at 7:29&#160;a.m. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24&#160;a.m. EDT after the president's doctor,Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the Acting President. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16&#160;a.m. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21&#160;a.m. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.[320]Judicial appointmentsSupreme CourtMain article:George W. Bush Supreme Court candidatesSupreme Court Justice nominee John Roberts and President Bush, July 19, 2005Following the announcement ofSupreme CourtJusticeSandra Day O'Connor's retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominatedJohn Robertsto succeed her. On September 5, following the death ofChief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist, this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House CounselHarriet Miersfor O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,[321]Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judgeSamuel Alito. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.[322]Other courtsMain article:List of federal judges appointed by George W. BushIn addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to theUnited States courts of appealsand 261 judges to theUnited States district courts. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind bothRonald ReaganandBill Clinton. Bush experienced a number ofjudicial appointment controversies. Debate during one confirmation session lasted "39 stupefying hours" according toThe New York Times. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations instatus quo, returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.[323][324][325]At the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the "Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites the New York Times as saying "Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny."[326]The Senate only confirmed 8 out of 60 judicial nominations by October 2001. In February 2003, the Democrats successfully filibustered the nomination ofMiguel Estrada.[327]Public image and perceptionDomesticMain article:Public image of George W.

Bush "was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public. He doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they are, so puts on a Texas act."[343]Job approvalBush began his presidency withapproval ratingsnear 50&#160;percent.[344]After theSeptember 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90&#160;percent,[345]maintaining 80 to 90&#160;percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50&#160;percent during most of his first term[15]and then fell to as low as 19&#160;percent in his second term.[346]In 2000 and again in 2004,Timemagazine named George W. Bush as itsPerson of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe "has done the most to influence the events of the year".[347]In May 2004,Gallupreported that 89&#160;percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush.[348]However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, andMiddle Easternaffairs.[349]Within the United States armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections.[350]While 73&#160;percent of military personnel said that they would vote for Bush, 18&#160;percent preferred his Democratic rival,John Kerry.[350]According toPeter D. Feaver, aDuke Universitypolitical scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.[350]Bush's approval rating went below the 50&#160;percent mark inAP-Ipsospolling in December 2004.[351]Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of theIraq War, hisresponse to Hurricane Katrinaand to theAbu Ghraib prisoner abuse,NSA warrantless surveillance, thePlame affair, andGuantanamo Bay detention campcontroversies.[352]There were calls for Bush'simpeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action.[353]The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy,[354]the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq,[355]and alleged violations of theGeneva Conventions.[356]RepresentativeDennis Kucinich(D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, butSpeakerNancy Pelosi(D-CA) declared that impeachment was "off the table".[357]Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37&#160;percent approval ratings for Bush,[358]the lowest for any second-term president at that point of his term sinceHarry S. Trumanin March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28&#160;percent),[351][359]which contributed to what Bush called the "thumping" of the Republican Party in the2006 mid-term elections.[360]Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;[361]the average for his entire second term was 37&#160;percent, according to Gallup.[362]President Bush's approval rating with key events marked, 2001&ndash;2006By the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19&#160;percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans.[346]Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being "the worst president,"[363][364]Bush would say, "I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls."[365]In the spring of that year, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of theGallup poll, with 69&#160;percent of those polled in April 2008 disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28&#160;percent approving&mdash;although the majority (66&#160;percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance.[366]In polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20&#160;percent,[367][368]while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67&#160;percent to as high as 75&#160;percent.[368][369]In polling conducted January 9&ndash;11, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34&#160;percent, which placed him on par withJimmy CarterandHarry Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30's (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24&#160;percent).[370]According to aCBS News/New York Timespoll conducted January 11&ndash;15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22&#160;percent.[367]Early in his presidency, following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, he had achieved the highest job approval rating of any American president since World War II, at 90&#160;percent;[366][367]but Bush left the White House as one of the most unpopular presidents, second in overall unpopularity only to Richard Nixon.[370][371]Foreign perceptionsPresident Bush with PresidentPervez Musharrafof the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, September 22, 2006Bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization campaigns for his administration's foreign policy.[372][373]Views of him within theinternational communitywere more negative than those of most previous American Presidents, even from close ally France.[374]Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the UK andVicente Foxof Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.[375][376][377]Other leaders, such as Afghan presidentHamid Karzai,[378]Ugandan presidentYoweri Museveni,[379]Spanish prime ministerJosé Luis Rodríguez Zapatero,[380]and Venezuelan presidentHugo Chávez,[381]openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him andVladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship.[382]Anti-war demonstration during President Bush's visit to London, June 2008In 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security.[383][384]In 2007, thePew Global Attitudes Projectreported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world.[385]A March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International and theUniversity of Marylandfound that Bush was the most disliked leader in the Arab world.[386]ThePew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that out of 47 countries, in only nine countries did most respondents express "a lot of confidence" or "some confidence" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda.[387]During a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim[388]Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8&#160;million,[389]has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy.[390]A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city ofTiranaflanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him.[391][392]A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled inFushe-Kruje, a few kilometers northwest ofTirana.[393]The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to theAlbanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy inBelgrade.[394]Acknowledgments and dedicationsOn May 7, 2005, during an official state visit to Latvia, Bush was awarded theOrder of the Three Starspresented to him by PresidentVaira V??e-Freiberga.[395]A few places outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, theTbilisiCity Council voted to rename a street in honor of the U.S. president.[396]Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links theGeorgiancapital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier.[397]A street inTirana, formerly known asRruga Puntorët e Rilendjes, situated directly outside theAlbanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007.[398]InJerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush.[399]In 2012, Estonian PresidentToomas Hendrik Ilvesawarded Bush theOrder of the Cross of Terra Marianafor his work in expanding NATO.[400]Post-presidency (2009&ndash;present)ResidenceGeorge and Laura Bush waving to a crowd of 1000 atAndrews Air Force Basebefore their final departure to Texas, January 20, 2009Following theinauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew fromAndrews Air Force Baseto a homecoming celebration inMidland, Texas, following which they returned to their ranch inCrawford, Texas.[401]They bought a home in thePreston Hollowneighborhood ofDallas, Texas, where they settled down.[402]He makes regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at theDallas Cowboysfirst game in the team's newstadiuminArlington[403]and an April 2009 visit to aTexas Rangersgame, where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation.[404]He also attended every home playoff game for theTexas Rangers2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the ceremonial first pitch atRangers Ballpark in Arlingtonfor Game 4 of the2010 World Serieson October 31, 2010.[405]On August 6, 2013, Bush was successfully treated for acoronary artery blockagewith astent. The blockage had been found during anannual medical examination.[406]MessagesGeorge W. Bush, President Obama, and Bill Clinton meeting in the Oval Office, January 16, 2010Since leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile[407]though he has made public appearances, most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of theSeptember 11 attacksin 2011. In March 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech inCalgary, Alberta,[408][409]appeared via video onThe Colbert Reportduring which he praised U.S. troops for earning a "special place in American history,"[410]and attended the funeral of SenatorTed Kennedy.[411]Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the "Get Motivated" seminar in Dallas.[412]In the aftermath of theFort Hood shootingthat took place on November 5, 2009, in Texas, the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and victims' families the day following the shooting, having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage.[413]Bush released his memoirs,Decision Points, on November 9, 2010. During a pre-release appearance promoting the book, Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping "the country safe amid a real danger", and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage ofSocial Security reform.[414]He also made news defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically thewaterboardingofKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, saying, "I'd do it again to save lives."[415]In 2012, he wrote the foreword ofThe 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, an economics book published by theGeorge W. Bush Presidential Center.[416][417][418]He also presented the book at theParkland Memorial Hospitalin Dallas, Texas.[419]Bush appeared onNBC'sThe Tonight Show with Jay Lenoon November 19, 2013, along with the formerFirst Lady. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about theObama administration, Bush said, "I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor."[420]Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized PresidentBarack Obamaat a meeting of theRepublican Jewish Coalitionat theVenetian Hotelin Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: "You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That&rsquo;s how Americans should view the deal." Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a "strategic blunder", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina SenatorLindsey Graham.[421]Alongside the 2014United States&ndash;Africa Leaders Summit, Bush,Michelle Obama, the State Department, and theGeorge W. Bush Institutehosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment ofHIV/AIDSmore difficult.[422]Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries.[423][424]On November 2, 2014, Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcomingMuseum of the Biblein Washington D.C.[51][425]Bush published abiographyof his father,George H.W. Bush, called41: A Portrait of My Father. It was released on November 11, 2014.[426]In an interview published byIsrael Hayommagazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said that he thought you would "need boots on the ground" in order to defeat theIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant(ISIS). He added that people had said during his Presidency that he should get out of Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troups in order to defeatAl Qaeda in Iraq, and Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining PresidentBarack Obama.[427]CollaborationsAt President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established theClinton Bush Haiti Fundto raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the2010 Haiti earthquakeearlier in January.[428]On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him thatOsama bin Laden had been killed.[429]The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush reada letterthat PresidentAbraham Lincolnwrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War.[430]Visual artAfter serving as president, Bush beganpaintingas ahobby. Subjects have included dogs andstill life.[431]He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair.[432][433][434]His paintings have been met with a middling reception by art critics. Bill Arning, director of theContemporary Arts Museum Houston, called his portraits "thickly painted in what I would call 'high-amateur' mode" and wrote, "I would say they need to be less based on photographic reproduction. You can tell when someone is taking a found photograph and making a painting out of it [...] I think he'd be well advised to work from other, multiple photographic sources or the real person to get a little bit more liveliness going on."[435]LegacyGeorge W. Bush's legacy remains a contested one, with both liberals and conservatives holding strong views on his overall place in history. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as theNo Child Left Behind Act, theMedicareprescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known asPEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling of theIraq War- specifically the failure to findweapons of mass destructionthat were the main rationale behind the initial invasion&#160;&mdash; as well as his handling oftax policy,Hurricane Katrinaand the2008 financial crisisas proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.[436][437]The No Child Left Behind Act has also become an area of criticism in recent years, as many academics[who?]have argued that states' increasing reliance onstandardized testingwhich resulted from the legislation has worsened American education.[citation needed]Despite the ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives, several historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history.Princeton Universityscholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a "transformative" one, and said that "some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on".[438]Bryon Williams ofThe Huffington Postreferred to Bush as "the most noteworthy president sinceFDR" and said that thePatriot Act"increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" as evidence.[439]Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since theReagan administration,[440]and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since theGreat Society.[441]Much of these policies has endured in the administration of Bush'sDemocraticsuccessor,Barack Obama.[442][443]Among the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that "Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office."[444]Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40&#160;percent in January 2009 and 35&#160;percent in March 2009, to 45&#160;percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.[445]Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.[446]In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47&#160;percent approval and 50&#160;percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for theWashington PostandABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005. Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53&#160;percent) and the Iraq War (57&#160;percent).[447]His 47&#160;percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period.[448]ACNNpoll conducted that same month found that 55&#160;percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with 80&#160;percent of Republican calling it a success, but only 43&#160;percent of independents calling it a success and nearly 90&#160;percent of Democrats calling it a failure.[449]While President Bush's approval rating among the public has seen an improvement, the most recent survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and Presidential scholars, conducted in 2010 by theSiena Research Institute, ranked him 39th out of 43 Presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.[450]See alsoBiography portalConservatism portalGovernment of the United States portalTexas portalBaseball portalBook: George W.
