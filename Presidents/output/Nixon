Nixon had previously served as aU.S. RepresentativeandSenatorfrom California and as the36th Vice President of the United Statesfrom 1953 to 1961.Nixon was born inYorba Linda, California. After completing his undergraduate work atWhittier College, he graduated fromDuke University School of Lawin 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife,Pat Nixon, moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942. He subsequently served in theUnited States NavyduringWorld War II. Nixon was elected to theHouse of Representativesin1946and to theSenatein1950. His pursuit of theHiss Caseestablished his reputation as a leading anti-communist, and elevated him to national prominence. He was therunning mateofDwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the1952 election. Nixon served for eight years asvice president. He waged an unsuccessfulpresidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing toJohn F. Kennedy, and lost a race forGovernor of Californiain1962. In1968he ran again for the presidency and waselected.Nixon ended American involvement in thewar in Vietnamin 1973 and brought the American prisoners home. At the same time he endedmilitary draft.Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of Chinain 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiateddétenteand theAnti-Ballistic Missile Treatywith the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from Washington to the states. He imposed wage and price controls, enforceddesegregationof Southern schools and established theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over theApollo 11moon landing which signaled the end of themoon race. He wasreelectedby one of the largest landslides in U.S. history in 1972.The year 1973 sawan Arab oil embargoand a continuing series of revelations about theWatergate scandal. The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certainimpeachmentand removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor,Gerald Ford. In retirement, Nixon's work authoring several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, anddied four days laterat the age of 81. Nixon remains a source of considerable interest among historians.Contents1Early life1.1Primary and secondary education1.2Collegiate and law school education2Early career, marriage, and war service3Rising politician3.1Congressional career3.2Vice Presidency3.31960 and 1962 elections; wilderness years41968 presidential election5Presidency (1969&ndash;74)5.1Foreign policy5.1.1China5.1.2Vietnam War5.1.3Latin American policy5.1.4Soviet Union5.1.5Middle Eastern policy5.2Domestic policy5.2.1Economy5.2.2Governmental initiatives and organization5.2.3Civil rights5.3Space policy5.4Reelection, Watergate scandal, and resignation5.4.11972 presidential campaign5.4.2Watergate5.4.3Resignation6Later years and death6.1Pardon and illness6.2Return to public life6.3Author and elder statesman6.4Death and funeral7Legacy8Personality and public image9See also10Notes10.1Explanatory notes10.2Citations11References11.1Bibliography11.2Nixon Library11.3Other sources12Further reading13External linksEarly lifeThe infant Richard stands outside the Nixons' Yorba Linda Home (early 1914), looking toward what is today theRichard Nixon Presidential Library and MuseumNixon was born on January 9, 1913 inYorba Linda, California, in a house his father built.[1][2]He was the son ofHannah (Milhous) NixonandFrancis A. Nixon. His mother was aQuakerand his father converted fromMethodismto the Quaker faith; Nixon's upbringing was marked by evangelical Quaker observances of the time, such as refraining from alcohol, dancing, and swearing. Nixon had four brothers: Harold (1909&ndash;33),Donald(1914&ndash;87),Arthur(1918&ndash;25), andEdward(born 1930).[3]Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendaryEngland; Richard, for example, was named afterRichard the Lionheart.[4][5]Nixon (second from right) makes his newspaper debut in 1916, contributing five cents to a fund for war orphans.Donaldis to the left of his brother.Nixon's early life was marked by hardship, and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood: "We were poor, but the glory of it was we didn't know it".[6]The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and the family moved toWhittier, California. In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station.[7]Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 after a short illness.[8]At the age of twelve, Richard was found to have a spot on his lung and, with a family history oftuberculosis, he was forbidden to play sports. Eventually, the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia.[9][10]Primary and secondary educationYoung Richard attended East Whittier Elementary School, where he was president of his eighth-grade class.[11]His parents believed that attendance atWhittier High Schoolhad caused Richard's older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before the older boy fell ill of tuberculosis (he died of the disease in 1933). Instead, they sent Richard to the largerFullerton Union High School.[12][13]He received excellent grades, even though he had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year&mdash;later, he lived with an aunt inFullertonduring the week.[14]He played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, even though he was rarely used in games.[15]He had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H. Lynn Sheller. Nixon later remembered Sheller's words, "Remember, speaking is conversation&#160;... don't shout at people. Talk to them. Converse with them."[16]Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible.[16]Nixon atWhittier High Schoolin 1930.His parents permitted Richard to transfer to Whittier High School for his junior year, beginning in September 1928. At Whittier High, Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat, for student body president. He generally rose at 4&#160;a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market. He then drove to the store to wash and display them, before going to school. Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football. Nevertheless, Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207&#160;students.[17]Collegiate and law school educationNixon was offered a tuition grant to attendHarvard University, but Harold's continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store. He remained in his hometown and attendedWhittier College, his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather.[18]Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football, but lacked the size to play. He remained on the team as a substitute, and was noted for his enthusiasm.[19]Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many members of the Franklins were from prominent families but Nixon was not. He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society.[20]In addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker.[21]In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief. The two broke up in 1935.[22]After his graduation from Whittier in 1934, Nixon received a full scholarship to attendDuke University School of Law.[23]The school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships.[24]It paid high salaries to its professors, many of whom had national or international reputations.[25]The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition.[24]Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association,[26]inducted into theOrder of the Coif,[27]and graduated third in his class in June 1937.[23]Early career, marriage, and war serviceAfter graduating from Duke, Nixon initially hoped to join theFederal Bureau of Investigation. He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later that he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts.[28]Instead, he returned to California and was admitted to thebarin 1937. He began practicing with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in Whittier,[23]working oncommercial litigationfor local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as onwills.[29]In later years, Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney. Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women.[30]In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley inLa Habra, California,[31]and became a full partner in the firm the following year.[32]In January 1938, Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production ofThe Dark Tower. There he played opposite a high school teacher namedThelma "Pat" Ryan.[23]Nixon described it in his memoirs as "a case of love at first sight"[33]&mdash;for Nixon only, as Pat Ryan turned down the young lawyer several times before agreeing to date him.[34]Once they began their courtship, Ryan was reluctant to marry Nixon; they dated for two years before she assented to his proposal. They wed at a small ceremony on June 21, 1940. After a honeymoon in Mexico, the Nixons began their married life in Whittier.[35]They had two daughters,Tricia(born 1946) andJulie(born 1948).[36]In January 1942, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., where Nixon took a job at theOffice of Price Administration.[23]In his political campaigns, Nixon would suggest that this was his response toPearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941. Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier.[37]He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later, applied to join theUnited States Navy.[38]As a birthright Quaker, he could have claimed exemption fromthe draft, but chose not to apply; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service. His application to enlist was successful, and he was inducted into the Navy in August 1942.[39]Nixon completedOfficers Candidate Schooland was commissioned as anensignin October 1942. His first post was as aide to the commander of theNaval Air Station OttumwainIowa. Seeking more excitement, he requested sea duty and was reassigned as the naval passenger control officer for theSouth Pacific Combat Air Transport Command, supporting thelogisticsof operations in theSouth West Pacific theater.[40][41]He was Officer in Charge of the Combat Air Transport Command at Guadalcanal in the Solomons and later at Green Island (Nissan island) just north ofBougainville. His unit prepared manifests and flight plans for C-47 operations and supervised the loading and unloading of the cargo aircraft. For this service he received aLetter of Commendationfor "meritorious and efficient performance of duty as Officer in Charge of the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command" On October 1, 1943, Nixon was promoted tolieutenant. Nixon earned twoservice starsand that citation of commendation, although he saw no actual combat. Upon his return to the U.S., Nixon was appointed the administrative officer of theAlameda Naval Air Stationin California. In January 1945, he was transferred to theBureau of Aeronauticsoffice in Philadelphia to help negotiate the termination of war contracts, and he received another letter of commendation for his work there.[42]Later, Nixon was transferred to other offices to work on contracts and finally to Baltimore.[43]In October 1945, he was promoted tolieutenant commander.[42]He resigned his commission on New Year's Day 1946.[44]Rising politicianRichard and Pat Nixon introduce GeneralDwight D. Eisenhower&mdash;Richard Nixon's running mate&mdash;to their daughtersTricia(standing) andJulie(carried by her father),Washington National Airport, September 10, 1952.Congressional careerFor more information on Nixon's congressional election campaigns, seeCalifornia's 12th congressional district election, 1946andUnited States Senate election in California, 1950.In 1945, Republicans inCalifornia's 12th congressional district, frustrated by their inability to defeat Democratic CongressmanJerry Voorhis, sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him. They formed a "Committee of 100" to decide on a candidate, hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to Voorhis victories. After the committee failed to attract higher-profile candidates, Herman Perry, Whittier'sBank of Americabranch manager, suggested Nixon, a family friend with whom he had served on the Whittier College Board of Trustees before the war. Perry wrote to Nixon inBaltimore. After a night of excited talk between the Nixons, the naval officer responded to Perry with enthusiasm. Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee. When he left the Navy at the start of 1946, Nixon and his wife returned to Whittier, where Nixon began a year of intensive campaigning.[45][46]He contended that Voorhis had been ineffective as a congressman and suggested that Voorhis's endorsement by a group linked to communists meant that Voorhis must have radical views.[47]Nixon won the election, receiving 65,586 votes to Voorhis' 49,994.[48]Nixon campaigns for the Senate in 1950In Congress, Nixon supported theTaft&ndash;Hartley Actof 1947, a federal law that monitors the activities and power of labor unions, and served on theEducation and Labor Committee. He was part of the Herter Committee, which went to Europe to report on the need for U.S. foreign aid. Nixon was the youngest member of the committee, and the only Westerner.[49]Advocacy by Herter Committee members, including Nixon, led to congressional passage of theMarshall Plan.[50]Nixon first gained national attention in 1948 when his investigation, as a member of theHouse Un-American Activities Committee(HUAC), broke theAlger Hissspy case. While many doubtedWhittaker Chambers' allegations that Hiss, a formerState Departmentofficial, had been a Soviet spy, Nixon believed them to be true and pressed for the committee to continue its investigation. Under suit for defamation filed by Hiss, Chambers produced documents corroborating his allegations. These included paper andmicrofilmcopies that Chambers turned over to House investigators after having hidden them overnight in a field; they became known as the "Pumpkin Papers".[51]Hiss was convicted ofperjuryin 1950 for denying under oath he had passed documents to Chambers.[52]In 1948, Nixon successfullycross-filedas a candidate in his district, winning both major party primaries,[53]and was comfortably reelected.[54]Nixon on his "station wagon tour" in Sausalito, California, 1950In 1949, Nixon began to consider running for theUnited States Senateagainst the Democratic incumbent,Sheridan Downey,[55]and entered the race in November of that year.[56]Downey, faced with a bitter primary battle with RepresentativeHelen Gahagan Douglas, announced his retirement in March 1950.[57]Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections[58]and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoingKorean Warwas a major issue.[59]Nixon tried to focus attention on Douglas' liberal voting record. As part of that effort, a "Pink Sheet" was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that, as Douglas' voting record was similar to that of New York CongressmanVito Marcantonio(believed by some to be a communist), their political views must be nearly identical.[60]Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points.[61]During this campaign, Nixon was first called "Tricky Dick" by his opponents for his campaign tactics.[62]In the Senate, Nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and speaking out against the threat.[63]He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist, the controversialWisconsinsenator,Joseph McCarthy, but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy's allegations.[64]Nixon also criticized PresidentHarry S. Truman's handling of the Korean War.[63]He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, voted in favor of civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia.[65]He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.[65]Vice PresidencyA piece of literature for the Eisenhower&ndash;Nixon campaign, 1952GeneralDwight D. Eisenhowerwas nominated for president by the Republicans in 1952. He had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate, and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a "smoke-filled room" and recommended Nixon to the general, who agreed to the senator's selection. Nixon's youth (he was then 39), stance against communism, and political base in California&mdash;one of the largest states&mdash;were all seen as vote-winners by the leaders. Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Ohio SenatorRobert A. Taft, New Jersey GovernorAlfred Driscolland Illinois SenatorEverett Dirksen.[66][67]On the campaign trail, Eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country, leaving the negative campaigning to hisrunning mate.[68]In mid-September, the Republican ticket faced a major crisis.[69]The media reported that Nixon had a political fund, maintained by his backers, which reimbursed him for political expenses.[70]Such a fund was not illegal, but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest. With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon's resignation from theticket, the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on September 23, 1952.[71]The address, later termed theCheckers speech, was heard by about 60 million Americans&mdash;including the largest television audience up to that point.[72]Nixon emotionally defended himself, stating that the fund was not secret, nor had donors received special favors. He painted himself as a man of modest means (his wife had no mink coat; instead she wore a "respectable Republican cloth coat") and a patriot.[71]The speech would be remembered for the gift which Nixon had received, but which he would not give back: "a little cocker spaniel dog ... sent all the way from Texas. And our little girl&mdash;Tricia, the 6-year-old&mdash;named it Checkers."[71]The speech was a masterpiece and prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon.[73]Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket,[74]which proved victorious inthe November election.[68]Eisenhower gave Nixon responsibilities during his term as vice president&mdash;more than any previous vice president.[75]Nixon attendedCabinetandNational Security Councilmeetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was absent. A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center. He visitedSaigonandHanoiinFrench Indochina.[76]On his return to the United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.[77]Biographer Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional years, said of his vice presidency:Eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office. The vice president welcomed the president's initiatives and worked energetically to accomplish White House objectives. Because of the collaboration between these two leaders, Nixon deserves the title, "the first modern vice president".[78]Despite intense campaigning by Nixon, who reprised his strong attacks on the Democrats, the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the1954 elections. These losses caused Nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term.[79]On September 24, 1955, President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack; his condition was initially believed to be life-threatening. Eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks. The25th Amendment to the United States Constitutionhad not yet been proposed, and the Vice President had no formal power to act. Nonetheless, Nixon acted in Eisenhower's stead during this period, presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power.[80]According to Nixon biographerStephen Ambrose, Nixon had "earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis&#160;... he made no attempt to seize power".[81]His spirits buoyed, Nixon sought a second term, but some of Eisenhower's aides aimed to displace him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon, however, believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956New Hampshire primaryelection. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate.[82]Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in theNovember 1956 election.[83]Vice President Nixon and Soviet PremierNikita Khrushchevargue as the press looks on in part of what came to be known as theKitchen Debate, July 24, 1959.In the spring of 1957, Nixon undertook another major foreign trip, this time to Africa. On his return, he helped shepherd theCivil Rights Act of 1957through Congress. The bill was weakened in the Senate, and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it. Nixon advised the President to sign the bill, which he did.[84]Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957, and Nixon gave a press conference, assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower's brief illness.[85]On April 27, 1958, Richard and Pat Nixon embarked on a goodwill tour of South America. InMontevideo, Uruguay, Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus, where he fielded questions from students on U.S. foreign policy. The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reachedLima, Peru, where he was met with student demonstrations. Nixon went to the campus, got out of his car to confront the students, and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects. At his hotel, Nixon faced another mob, and one demonstrator spat on him.[86]InCaracas, Venezuela, Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti-American demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe-wielding mob.[87]According to Ambrose, Nixon's courageous conduct "caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect".[88]In July 1959, President Eisenhower sent Nixon to theSoviet Unionfor the opening of theAmerican National Exhibitionin Moscow. On July 24, while touring the exhibits with Soviet PremierNikita Khrushchev, the two stopped at a model of an American kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the "Kitchen Debate".[89]1960 and 1962 elections; wilderness yearsMain article:United States presidential election, 1960In 1960, Nixon launched his first campaign for President of the United States. He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries[90]and chose former Massachusetts SenatorHenry Cabot Lodge Jr.as his running mate.[91]His Democratic opponent wasJohn F. Kennedy, and the race remained close for the duration.[92]Nixon campaigned on his experience, but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed theEisenhower&ndash;Nixon administrationhad allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the U.S. inballistic missiles(the "missile gap").[93]A new political medium was introduced in the campaign: televisedpresidential debates. In the first of four such debates, Nixon appeared pale, with afive o'clock shadow, in contrast to the photogenic Kennedy.[91]Nixon's performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television, though many people listening on the radio thought that Nixon had won.[94]Nixon lost the election narrowly, with Kennedy ahead by only 120,000 votes (0.2&#160;percent) in the popular vote.[91]Outgoing Vice President Nixon and Vice President-elect Lyndon Johnson leave the White House on the morning of January 20, 1961, for the Kennedy&ndash;Johnson inauguration ceremoniesThere were charges ofvote fraudin Texas and Illinois, both states won by Kennedy; Nixon refused to consider contesting the election, feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States in the eyes of the world, and the uncertainty would hurt U.S. interests.[95]At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book,Six Crises, which included coverage of the Hiss case, Eisenhower's heart attack, and the Fund Crisis, which had been resolved by the Checkers speech.[91][96]Local and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbentPat BrownforGovernor of Californiainthe 1962 election.[91]Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race.[91]The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping-stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own lack of interest in being California's governor.[91]Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics.[97]Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career.[91]Inan impromptu concession speechthe morning after the election, Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference".[98]The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode ofABC'sHoward K. Smith: News and Commententitled "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon".[99]Alger Hiss appeared on the program, and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president. The furor drove Smith and his program from the air,[100]and public sympathy for Nixon grew.[99]Nixon shows his papers to an East German officer to cross between the sectors of the divided city of Berlin, 1963The Nixon family traveled to Europe in 1963, where Nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited.[101]The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a seniorpartnerin the leading law firmNixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie &amp; Alexander.[91]Nixon had pledged, when announcing his California campaign, not to run for president in 1964; even if he had not, he believed it would be difficult to defeat Kennedy, or afterhis assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson.[102]In 1964, he supported Arizona SenatorBarry Goldwaterfor the Republican nomination for president; when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination, Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate tothe convention. Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win, Nixon campaigned for him loyally.The electionwas a disaster for the Republicans; Goldwater's landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors.[103]Nixon was one of the few leading Republicans not blamed for the disastrous results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election.[104]1968 presidential electionMain articles:Richard Nixon presidential campaign, 1968andUnited States presidential election, 1968Nixon and Johnson meet at the White House before Nixon's nomination, July 1968.A Nixon campaign posterAt the end of 1967, Nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life[105](for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech),[106]she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of theVietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.[105]Text on automobile trash bag given away by the Nixon campaign in California, 1968One of the most tumultuousprimary electionseasons ever began as theTet Offensivewas launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded withthe assassinationof one of the Democratic candidates, SenatorRobert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan GovernorGeorge Romney, though New York GovernorNelson Rockefellerand California GovernorRonald Reaganeach hoped to be nominated in abrokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot.[107]He selected Maryland GovernorSpiro Agnewas his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.[108]Nixon's Democratic opponent in the general election was Vice PresidentHubert Humphrey, who was nominated ata conventionmarkedby violent protests.[109]Throughout the campaign, Nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval.[109]He appealed to what he later called the "silent majority" ofsocially conservativeAmericans who disliked thehippie countercultureand theanti-wardemonstrators. Agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups, solidifying Nixon's position with the right.[110]Nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign, meeting with supporters in front of cameras.[111]He stressed that the crime rate was too high, and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the Democrats of the United States' nuclear superiority.[112]Nixon promised "peace with honor" in the Vietnam War and proclaimed that "new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the Pacific".[113]He did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war, resulting in media intimations that he must have a "secret plan".[113]His slogan of "Nixon's the One" proved to be effective.[111]Johnson's negotiators hoped to reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon received astute analysis on the talks fromHenry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiatorAverell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact withAnna Chennaultin Saigon. She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu not to go to Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.[114]In a three-way race between Nixon, Humphrey, and independent candidate former Alabama GovernorGeorge Wallace, Nixon defeated Humphrey by nearly 500,000 votes (seven-tenths of a percentage point), with 301 electoral votes to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace.[109][115]In his victory speech, Nixon pledged that his administration would try tobring the divided nation together.[116]Nixon said: "I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President, congratulating me for winning the election. I congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds. I also told him that I know exactly how he felt. I know how it feels to lose a close one."[117]Presidency (1969&ndash;74)Main article:Presidency of Richard NixonNixon is sworn in as the 37th President by Chief JusticeEarl Warrenon January 20, 1969, with the new First Lady, Pat, holding the family Bibles.Nixonwas inauguratedaspresidenton January 20, 1969, sworn in by his onetime political rival,Chief JusticeEarl Warren. Pat Nixon held the family Bibles open atIsaiah2:4, which reads, "They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks." In his inaugural address, which received almost uniformly positive reviews, Nixon remarked that "the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker"[118]&mdash;a phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone.[119]He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity:In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading. We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another, until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices.[120]Foreign policyNixon and Chinese PremierZhou Enlaitoast during Nixon's 1972 visit to ChinaChinaMain article:1972 Nixon visit to ChinaPresident Nixon shakes hands with Chinese PremierZhou Enlaiupon arriving in Beijing, 1972.Nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China even before he became president, writing inForeign Affairsa year before his election: "There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation."[121]Assisting him in this venture was hisNational Security Advisorand future Secretary of State,Henry Kissinger, with whom the President worked closely, bypassing Cabinet officials. With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir&mdash;border clashes between the twotook place during Nixon's first year in office&mdash;Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations. A breakthrough came in early 1971, whenChairman Maoinvited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players. Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials.[121]On July 15, 1971, it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon (on television and radio) that the President would visit China the following February. The announcements astounded the world.[122]The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact.[123]In February 1972, Nixon and his wife traveled to China. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40&#160;hours in preparation.[124]Upon touching down, the President and First Lady emerged fromAir Force Oneand greeted Chinese PremierZhou Enlai. Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou's hand, something which then-Secretary of StateJohn Foster Dulleshad refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva.[125]Over 100&#160;television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print. It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised.[125]President Nixon greetsChinese Communist Party ChairmanMao Zedong(left) in a historic visit to the People's Republic of China, 1972.Nixon and Kissinger met for an hour with Mao and Zhou at Mao's official private residence, where they discussed a range of issues.[126]Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon, whom he considered forthright, unlike the leftists and the Soviets.[126]He said he was suspicious of Kissinger,[126]though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his "encounter with history".[125]A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in theGreat Hall of the People. The following day, Nixon met with Zhou; the joint communique following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China, and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification.[127]When not in meetings, Nixon toured architectural wonders including theForbidden City,Ming Tombs, and theGreat Wall.[125]Americans received their first glimpse into Chinese life through the cameras which accompanied Pat Nixon, who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes, schools, factories, and hospitals.[125]The visit ushered in a new era of Sino-American relations.[109]Fearing the possibility of a Sino-American alliance, the Soviet Union yielded to pressure fordétentewith the United States.[128]Vietnam WarMain articles:Vietnam WarandRole of the United States in the Vietnam WarWhen Nixon took office, about 300 American soldiers were dying each week in Vietnam,[129]and the war was broadly unpopular in the United States, with violent protests against the war ongoing. The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions, but this agreement never fully took force. According to Walter Isaacson, soon after taking office, Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly.[130]Conversely, Black argues that Nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate North Vietnam through the "Madman theory".[131]Nixon sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw, while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack.[132]Nixon delivers an address to the nation about the Cambodian incursionNixon approved a secret bombing campaign of North Vietnamese and alliedKhmer Rougepositions inCambodiain March 1969 (code-namedOperation Menu),[133]a policy begun under Johnson.[134]These operations resulted in heavy bombing of Cambodia; by one measurement more bombs were dropped over Cambodia under Johnson and Nixon than the Allies dropped during World War II.[134]In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, did not result in an agreement.[135]In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections withViet Congparticipation.[136]In July 1969, Nixon visitedSouth Vietnam, where he met with his U.S. military commanders and PresidentNguyen Van Thieu. Amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout, he implemented a strategy of replacing American troops withVietnamese troops, known as "Vietnamization".[109]He soon instituted phased U.S. troop withdrawals[137]but authorized incursions intoLaos, in part to interrupt theHo Chi Minh trail, used to supply North Vietnamese forces, that passed through Laos and Cambodia. Nixon announced the ground invasion of Cambodia to the American public on April 30, 1970.[138]His responses to protesters included an impromptu, early morning meeting with them at theLincoln Memorialon May 9, 1970.[139][140][141]Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated byPol Pot's then second in command,Nuon Chea.[142]Nixon's campaign promise to curb the war, contrasted with the escalated bombing, led to claims that Nixon had a "credibility gap" on the issue.[137]In 1971, excerpts from the "Pentagon Papers", which had been leaked byDaniel Ellsberg, were published byThe New York TimesandThe Washington Post. When news of the leak first appeared, Nixon was inclined to do nothing; the Papers, a history of United States' involvement in Vietnam, mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations. He was persuaded by Kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared, and the President tried to prevent publication. The Supreme Court eventually ruled for the newspapers.[143]As U.S. troop withdrawals continued,conscriptionwas reduced and in 1973 ended; the armed forces became all-volunteer.[144]After years of fighting, theParis Peace Accordswere signed at the beginning of 1973. The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops; however, it did not require the 160,000North Vietnam Armyregulars located in the South to withdraw.[145]Once American combat support ended, there was a brief truce, before fighting broke out again, this time without American combat involvement. North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975.[146]Latin American policyNixon and Mexican presidentGustavo Díaz Ordazriding a presidential motorcade in San Diego, California, September 1970.Nixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy in the 1961Bay of Pigs Invasionand 1962Cuban Missile Crisis; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president,Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend,Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process had not yet been completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port ofCienfuegosin October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.[147]The election of Marxist candidateSalvador AllendeasPresident of Chilein September 1970 spurred Nixon and Kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende,[148]:25first designed to convince the Chilean congress to confirmJorge Alessandrias the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup.[148]Other support included strikes organized against Allende and funding for Allende opponents. It was even alleged that "Nixon personally authorized" $700,000 in covert funds to print anti-Allende messages in a prominent Chilean newspaper.[148]:93Following an extended period of social, political, and economic unrest, GeneralAugusto Pinochetassumed power in a violentcoup d'étaton September 11, 1973; among thedead was Allende.[149]Soviet UnionNixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace. Following the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union. The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972 and met withLeonid Brezhnev, theGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party;Alexei Kosygin, theChairman of the Council of Ministers; andNikolai Podgorny, thehead of state, among other leading Soviet officials.[150]Nixon meets with Brezhnev during the Soviet leader's trip to the U.S. in 1973.Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev.[150]Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties:SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers,[109]and theAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence". A banquet was held that evening at theKremlin.[150]Seeking to foster better relations with the United States, both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily.[151][152][153]Nixon later described his strategy:I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist, if possible, the help of the Soviets and the Chinese. Though rapprochement with China and détente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves, I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war. At worst, Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing. At best, if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry, Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept.[154]Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974.[155]He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at theGrand Kremlin Palacethat evening.[155]Nixon and Brezhnev met inYalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, détente, andMIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it.[155]There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations.[155]Middle Eastern policyNixon meets with PresidentAnwar Sadatof Egypt, June 1974.As part of theNixon Doctrinethat the U.S. would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East&mdash;particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia&mdash;during the Nixon administration.[156]The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that&mdash;except during theSuez Crisis&mdash;the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table. However, the Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term&mdash;for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.[a]On October 6, 1973, an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, supported with tons of arms and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in what was known as theYom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, by the time the U.S. and Soviet Union begannegotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper-hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military toDEFCON3,[157]placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.[158]Because Israel's victory was largely due to U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., resulting in the1973 oil crisis.[159]The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.[160]After the war, and under Nixon's presidency, the U.S. reestablished relations with Egypt for the first time since 1967. Nixon used the Middle East crisis to restartthe stalled Middle East Peace Negotiations; he wrote in a confidential memo to Kissinger on October 20:I believe that, beyond a doubt, we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East. I am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by... I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves.[161]Nixon made one of his final international visits as president to the Middle East in June 1974, and became the first President to visit Israel.[162]Domestic policyAt theWashington Senators' 1969 Opening Day atRFK Stadium. To Nixon's left is team ownerBob Short. Baseball CommissionerBowie Kuhnis on the left side of Short. Marine Corps Aide to the President, ColonelJack Brennan, sits behind Nixon to his left.EconomyFurther information:Nixon Shockand1970s energy crisisAt the time Nixon took office in 1969, inflation was at 4.7&#160;percent&mdash;its highest rate since the Korean War. TheGreat Societyhad been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century.[163]Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war.[163]This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency).[164]According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency.[165]Nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies, but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition, and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection. As part of his "New Federalism" views, he proposed grants to the states, but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process. However, Nixon gained political credit for advocating them.[164]In 1970, Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.[165]With inflation unresolved by August 1971, and an election year looming, Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers atCamp David. He then announced temporary wage and price controls, allowed the dollar to float against other currencies, and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold.[166]Bowles points out, "by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation's defeat, Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents&#160;... to criticize him. His opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself."[165]Nixon's policies dampened inflation through 1972, although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration.[166]After he won reelection, Nixon found inflation returning.[167]He reimposed price controls in June 1973. The price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy.[167]The controls producedfood shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss.[167]Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.[167]Governmental initiatives and organizationNixon advocated a "New Federalism", which would devolve power to state and local elected officials, though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them.[168]He eliminated the Cabinet-levelUnited States Post Office Department, which in 1971 became the government-runUnited States Postal Service.[169]Nixon was a late convert to theconservation movement. Environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the firstEarth Dayin April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of theEnvironmental Protection Agency(EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in hisState of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included theClean Air Act of 1970andOccupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA); theNational Environmental Policy Actrequiredenvironmental impact statementsfor many Federal projects.[170]Nixon vetoed theClean Water Actof 1972&mdash;objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixonimpoundedthe funds he deemed unjustifiable.[171]In 1971, Nixon proposed health insurance reform&mdash;a private health insurance employer mandate,[b]federalization ofMedicaidfor poor families with dependent minor children,[172]and support forhealth maintenance organizations(HMOs).[173]A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973.[173]In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform&mdash;a private health insurance employer mandate[b]and replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based premiums andcost sharing.[174]Concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among American soldiers in Vietnam, Nixon called for aWar on Drugs, pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad, and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities.[175]As one policy initiative, Nixon called for more money forsickle cellresearch, treatment, and education in February 1971[176]and signed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act on May 16, 1972.[177][178][c]While Nixon called for increased spending on such high-profile items as cancer and sickle cell, at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at theNational Institutes of Health.[179]Civil rightsThe Nixon years witnessed the first large-scaleintegrationof public schools in the South.[180]Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites.[181]Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders&mdash;both white and black&mdash;to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor SecretaryGeorge Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over thebusingof children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.[182]In addition to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented thePhiladelphia Planin 1970&mdash;the first significant federalaffirmative actionprogram.[183]He also endorsed theEqual Rights Amendmentafter it passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification.[184]Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election. Nevertheless, he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had.[185]Space policyNixon visits theApollo 11astronauts in quarantine aboard USSHornet.Further information:Space policy of the United StatesAfter anearly decade-long national effort, the United States won the race to land astronauts on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with the flight ofApollo 11. Nixon spoke withNeil ArmstrongandBuzz Aldrinduring their moonwalk. He called the conversation "the most historic phone call ever made from the White House".[186]Nixon, however, was unwilling to keep funding for theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) at the high level seen through the 1960s as NASA prepared to send men to the Moon. NASA AdministratorThomas O. Painedrew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981. Nixon, however, rejected both proposals due to the expense.[187]Nixon also canceled the Air ForceManned Orbital Laboratoryprogram in 1969, because unmannedspy satelliteswere shown to be a more cost-effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective.[188]On March 7, 1970, Nixon announced the end of the Kennedy-Johnson era's massive efforts in thespace race, stating "We must think of [space activities] as part of a continuing process... and not as a series of separate leaps, each requiring a massive concentration of energy. Space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities... What we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are important to us." He then cancelled the last three planned Apollo lunar missions to placeSkylabin orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of theSpace Shuttle.[189]On May 24, 1972, Nixon approved a five-year cooperative program between NASA and theSoviet space program, culminating in the 1975joint mission of an American Apollo and Soviet Soyuz spacecraftlinking in space.[190]Reelection, Watergate scandal, and resignationNixon announces the release of edited transcripts of the Watergate tapes, April 29, 1974.1972 presidential campaignMain article:United States presidential election, 1972Nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment ofpolitical realignment. The Democratic "Solid South" had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions. Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing theCivil Rights Act of 1964but had alienated more moderate Southerners. Nixon's efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace's candidacy. Through his first term, he pursued aSouthern Strategywith policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of theCivil Rights era. He nominated two Southern conservatives,Clement HaynsworthandG. Harrold Carswellto the Supreme Court, but neither was confirmed by the Senate.[191]Nixon meets the public during the 1972 presidential campaign.Nixon entered his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection.[192]Virtually assured the Republican nomination,[193]the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to beMassachusettsSenatorTed Kennedy(brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969Chappaquiddick incident.[194]Instead,MaineSenatorEdmund Muskiebecame the front runner, withSouth DakotaSenatorGeorge McGovernin a close second place.[192]On June 10, McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination.[195]The following month, Nixon was renominated at the1972 Republican National Convention. He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive.[196]McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending[197]and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well asabortion rights. With some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization, McGovern was perceived as standing for "amnesty, abortion and acid". McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate,MissouriSenatorThomas Eagleton, dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment fordepression.[198][199]Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle, and was reelected on November 7, 1972 inone of the largest landslide election victories in American history. He defeated McGovern with over 60&#160;percent of the popular vote, losing only in Massachusetts and theDistrict of Columbia.[200]WatergateNixon fields questions at a press conference, October 26, 1973.Main articles:Watergate scandalandImpeachment process of Richard NixonThe termWatergatehas come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. Those activities included "dirty tricks," or bugging the offices of political opponents and the harassment of activist groups and political figures. The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into Democratic party headquarters at theWatergate complexin Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972.The Washington Postpicked up on the story; reportersCarl BernsteinandBob Woodwardrelied on an informant known as "Deep Throat"&mdash;later revealed to beMark Felt, associate director at the FBI&mdash;to link the men to the Nixon administration. Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics, calling news articles biased and misleading. A series of revelations made it clear that the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, and later the White House, was involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats. Senior aides such asWhite House CounselJohn Deanfaced prosecution; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing.[109][201][202]In July 1973, White House aideAlexander Butterfieldtestified under oath to Congress that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office.These tapesweresubpoenaedby Watergate Special CounselArchibald Cox; Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes, citingexecutive privilege. With the White House and Cox at loggerheads, Nixon had Cox fired in October in the "Saturday Night Massacre"; he was replaced byLeon Jaworski. In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations, held in the White House on June 20, 1972, featured an 18˝ minute gap.[202]Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, though her tale was widely mocked. The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up.[203]A demonstrator demands Nixon'simpeachment, October 1973.Though Nixon lost much popular support, even from his own party, he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office.[202]He insisted that he had made mistakes, but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973.[204]On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned &mdash;unrelated to Watergate&mdash; and was convicted on charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland. Nixon choseGerald Ford,Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew.[205]On November 17, 1973, during a televised question and answer session with the press,[206]Nixon said,"People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got."[207]The legal battle over the tapes continued through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides. TheHouse Judiciary Committeeopenedimpeachmenthearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment.[204]On July 24, the Supreme Courtruled unanimouslythat the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.[208]The scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the President, ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes; Nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due, and paid $465,000 in back taxes in 1974.[209]Even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations, Nixon hoped to fight the charges. However, one of the new tapes, recorded soon after the break-in, demonstrated that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and had approved plans to thwart the investigation. In a statement accompanying the release of what became known asthe "Smoking Gun Tape"on August 5, 1974, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had a lapse of memory.[210]He met with Republican congressional leaders soon after, and was told he faced certain impeachment in the House and had, at most, only 15 votes in his favor in the Senate&mdash; far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office.[211]ResignationRichard Nixon resignsSorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.You candownload the clipordownload a playerto play the clip in your browser.Resignation speech of President Richard Nixon, delivered August 8, 1974.Problems playing this file?

Nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president, Gerald Ford. Nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency, especially in foreign policy.[212]He defended his record as president, quoting fromTheodore Roosevelt's 1910 speechCitizenship in a Republic:Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed, but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena, "whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deed, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly".[213]Nixon's speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators, with onlyRoger MuddofCBSstating that Nixon had not admitted wrongdoing.[214]It was termed "a masterpiece" byConrad Black, one of his biographers. Black opined that "What was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any American president, Nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue. He left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office."[215]Later years and deathPresidentRonald Reaganmeets with his three predecessors, Ford,Carterand Nixon at the White House, October 1981; the three former presidents represented the United States at the funeral of Egyptian PresidentAnwar Sadat.Pardon and illnessPresident Ford announces his decision to pardon Nixon, September 8, 1974, in theOval OfficeFollowing his resignation, the Nixons flew to their homeLa Casa PacificainSan Clemente, California.[216]According to his biographer,Aitken, after his resignation, "Nixon was a soul in torment".[217]Congress had funded Nixon's transition costs, including some salary expenses, though reducing the appropriation from $850,000 to $200,000. With some of his staff still with him, Nixon was at his desk by 7&#160;a.m.&mdash;with little to do.[217]His former press secretary,Ron Ziegler, sat with him alone for hours each day.[218]Nixon's resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished. The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon, though it would be unpopular in the country. Nixon, contacted by Ford emissaries, was initially reluctant to accept the pardon, but then agreed to do so. Ford, however, insisted on a statement of contrition; Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document. Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a "full, free, and absolute pardon", which ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement:I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy. No words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and the presidency, a nation I so deeply love, and an institution I so greatly respect.[219][220]In October 1974, Nixon fell ill withphlebitis. Told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die, a reluctant Nixon chose surgery, and President Ford visited him in the hospital. Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides&mdash;Dean, Haldeman, andJohn Ehrlichman&mdash;andThe Washington Post, disbelieving his illness, printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the "wrong foot". JudgeJohn Siricaexcused Nixon's presence despite the defendants' objections.[221]Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon's presidential papers&mdash;beginning a three-decade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate.[222]Nixon was in the hospital when the1974 midterm electionswere held, and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 43&#160;seats in the House and three in the Senate.[223]Return to public lifeIn December 1974, Nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable ill-will against him in the country. He wrote in his diary, referring to himself and Pat,So be it. We will see it through. We've had tough times before and we can take the tougher ones that we will have to go through now. That is perhaps what we were made for&mdash;to be able to take punishment beyond what anyone in this office has had before particularly after leaving office. This is a test of character and we must not fail the test.[224]Nixon (right) joinsGerald Ford(center) and PresidentJimmy Carter(left) at the White House for the funeral of former Vice PresidentHubert Humphrey, 1978.By early 1975, Nixon's health was improving. He maintained an office in aCoast Guardstation 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs.[225]He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly.[226]He was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with much of his staff, including Ziegler.[227]In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producerDavid Frost, who paid him $600,000 fora series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977.[228]They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had "let down the country" and that "I brought myself down. I gave them a sword and they stuck it in. And they twisted it with relish. And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing."[229]The interviews garnered 45&ndash;50&#160;million viewers&mdash;becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history.[230]The interviews helped improve Nixon's financial position&mdash;at one point in early 1975 he had only $500 in the bank&mdash;as did the sale of his Key Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy Nixon friends such asBebe Rebozo.[231]In February 1976, Nixon visited China at the personal invitation of Mao. Nixon had wanted to return to China, but chose to wait until after Ford's own visit in 1975.[232]Nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between Ford and Reagan. Ford won, but was defeated byGeorgiaGovernorJimmy Carterinthe general election. The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia, causing the government of Prime MinisterMalcolm Fraserto withhold its official invitation.[233]In 1976, Nixon was disbarred in the state of New York for obstruction of justice in the Watergate affair. Nixon chose not to present any defense.[234]In early 1978, Nixon went to the United Kingdom. He was shunned by American diplomats and by most ministers of theJames Callaghangovernment. He was welcomed, however, by theLeader of the Opposition,Margaret Thatcher, as well as by former prime ministersLord HomeandSir Harold Wilson. Two other former prime ministers,Harold MacmillanandEdward Heathdeclined to meet him. Nixon addressed theOxford Unionregarding Watergate:Some people say I didn't handle it properly and they're right. I screwed it up.Mea culpa. But let's get on to my achievements. You'll be here in the year 2000 and we'll see how I'm regarded then.[235]Author and elder statesmanNixon speaks with Chinese Vice PremierDeng Xiaopingand U.S. President Jimmy Carter at the White House, 1979.In 1978, Nixon published his memoirs,RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement.[216]The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response.[236]Nixon journeyed to the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice PremierDeng Xiaoping. Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.[237]On August 10, 1979, the Nixons purchased a New York City townhouse at 817Fifth Avenue[238]after being rejected by two Manhattanco-ops.[239]When the formerShah of Irandied in Egypt in July 1980, Nixon defied the State Department, which intended to send no U.S. representative, by attending the funeral. Though Nixon had no official credentials, as a former president he was seen as the American presence at its former ally's funeral.[240]Nixon supported Ronald Reagan for president in1980, making television appearances portraying himself as, in biographer Stephen Ambrose's words, "the senior statesman above the fray".[241]He wrote guest articles for many publications both during the campaign and after Reagan's victory.[242]After eighteen months in the New York City townhouse, Nixon and his wife moved in 1981 toSaddle River, New Jersey.[216]Throughout the 1980s, Nixon maintained an ambitious schedule of speaking engagements and writing,[216]traveled, and met with many foreign leaders, especially those of Third World countries. He joined former Presidents Ford and Carter as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian PresidentAnwar Sadat.[216]On a trip to the Middle East, Nixon made his views known regarding Saudi Arabia and Libya, which attracted significant U.S. media attention;The Washington Postran stories on Nixon's "rehabilitation".[243]Nixon journeyed to the Soviet Union in 1986 and on his return sent President Reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions ofMikhail Gorbachev.[216]Following this trip, Nixon was ranked ina Gallup pollas one of the ten most admired men in the world.[244]Nixon visits PresidentBill Clintonin the White House family quarters, March 1993.In 1986, Nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers, impressing his audience with histour d'horizonof the world.[245]At the time,political punditElizabeth Drew wrote, "Even when he was wrong, Nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory, as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority, enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times."[245]Newsweekran a story on "Nixon's comeback" with the headline "He's back".[246]On July 19, 1990, the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace inYorba Linda, California opened as a private institution with the Nixons in attendance. They were joined by a large crowd of people, including Presidents Ford, Reagan, andGeorge H. W. Bush, as well as their wives,Betty,Nancy, andBarbara.[247]In January 1991, the former president founded the Nixon Center (today theCenter for the National Interest), a Washington policythink tankand conference center.[248]Pat Nixon died on June 22, 1993, ofemphysemaand lung cancer. Her funeral services were held on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace. Former President Nixon was distraught throughout the interment and delivered a moving tribute to her inside the library building.[249]Death and funeralMain article:Death and funeral of Richard NixonFive U.S. presidents (including then-incumbent presidentBill Clinton) and their first ladies attend the funeral of Richard Nixon, April 27, 1994.Nixon suffered a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in hisPark Ridge, New Jersey home.[250]Ablood clotresulting from his heart condition had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken toNew York Hospital&ndash;Cornell Medical CenterinManhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg.[250]Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08&#160;p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.[250]Nixon's funeral took place on April 27, 1994 inYorba Linda, California. Eulogists at the Nixon Library ceremony included PresidentBill Clinton, former Secretary of StateHenry Kissinger, Senate Minority LeaderBob Dole, California GovernorPete Wilson, and the ReverendBilly Graham. Also in attendance were former Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and their wives.[251]Richard Nixon is buried beside his wife Pat on the grounds of the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters,TriciaandJulie, and four grandchildren.[250]In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a fullstate funeral, though his body didlie in reposein the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service.[252]Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects.[253]At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an estimated 42,000 people waiting to pay their respects.[254]John F. Stacks ofTimemagazine said of Nixon shortly after his death, "An outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every self-created disaster that he faced. To reclaim a respected place in American public life after his resignation, he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the world's leaders&#160;... and by the time Bill Clinton came to the White House [in 1993], Nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman. Clinton, whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach Nixon, met openly with him and regularly sought his advice."[255]Tom WickerofThe New York Timesnoted that Nixon had been equalled only byFranklin Rooseveltin being five times nominated on a major party ticket and, quoting Nixon's 1962 farewell speech, wrote, "Richard Nixon's jowly, beard-shadowed face, the ski-jump nose and the widow's peak, the arms upstretched in the V-sign, had been so often pictured and caricatured, his presence had become such a familiar one in the land, he had been so often in the heat of controversy, that it was hard to realize the nation really would not 'have Nixon to kick around anymore'."[256]Ambrose said of the reaction to Nixon's death, "To everyone's amazement, except his, he's our beloved elder statesman."[257]Upon Nixon's death, almost all of the news coverage mentioned Watergate, but for the most part, the coverage was favorable to the former president.The Dallas Morning Newsstated, "History ultimately should show that despite his flaws, he was one of our most farsighted chief executives."[258]This offended some; columnistRussell Bakercomplained of "a group conspiracy to grant him absolution".[259]CartoonistJeff Koterbaof theOmaha World-Heralddepicted History before a blank canvas, his subject Nixon, as America looks on eagerly. The artist urges his audience to sit down; the work will take some time to complete, as "this portrait is a little more complicated than most".[260]LegacyHistorian and political scientistJames MacGregor Burnsobserved of Nixon, "How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?"[261]Nixon's biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history. According to Ambrose, "Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished. What he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation."[262]Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional career, suggests that "he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-Communist course against the excess of McCarthy".[263]Aitken feels that "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues. Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism, no simple verdict is possible."[264]The graves of President Richard Nixon (right) and First Lady Pat NixonNixon's Southern Strategy is credited by some historians as causing the South to become a Republican stronghold, though others deem economic factors more important to the change.[191]Throughout his career, he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists, and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet communism.[265]According to his biographer, Herbert Parmet, "Nixon's role was to steer the Republican party along a middle course, somewhere between the competitive impulses of the Rockefellers, the Goldwaters, and the Reagans."[266]Nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs, which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation. Historian Paul Charles Milazzo in his 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment, points to Nixon's creation of the EPA and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973Endangered Species Act, stating that "though unsought and unacknowledged, Richard Nixon's environmental legacy is secure."[267]Nixon saw his policies regarding Vietnam, China, and the Soviets as key to his place in history.[156]George McGovern, Nixon's onetime opponent, commented in 1983, "President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II&#160;... With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history."[268]Political scientist Jussi M. Hanhimäki disagrees, saying Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy ofcontainment, using diplomatic rather than military means.[156]Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a negative legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate.[269]During theimpeachment of Bill Clintonin 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent.[270]Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power toGeorge W. Bushin the aftermath of the9/11 attacksrestored the president's power.[269]Personality and public imageNixon andElvis Presleyin December 1970: "The President &amp; The King"Nixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow.[271]Nixon had a complex personality, both very secretive and awkward, yet strikingly reflective about himself. He was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects, wearing a coat and tie even when home alone.[272]Nixon biographerConrad Blackdescribed him as being "driven" though also "uneasy with himself in some ways".[273]According to Black, Nixon "thought that he was doomed to be traduced, double-crossed, unjustly harassed, misunderstood, underappreciated, and subjected to the trials ofJob, but that by the application of his mighty will, tenacity, and diligence, he would ultimately prevail".[274]Biographer Elizabeth Drew summarized Nixon as a "smart, talented man, but most peculiar and haunted of presidents".[275]In his account of the Nixon presidency, author Richard Reeves described Nixon as "a strange man of uncomfortable shyness, who functioned best alone with his thoughts".[276]Nixon's presidency was doomed by his personality, Reeves argues: "He assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them&#160;... He clung to the idea of being 'tough'. He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness."[277]Nixon withBebe Rebozo(left) and FBI DirectorJ. Edgar Hoover. The three men relax before dinner, Key Biscayne, Florida, December 1971.Nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president. Even Bebe Rebozo, by some accounts his closest friend, did not call him by his first name. Nixon stated of this, "Even with close friends, I don't believe in letting your hair down, confiding this and that and the other thing&mdash;saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep'&#160;... I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself. That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts&#160;... [and] reveal their inner psyche&mdash;whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way."[278]When told that most Americans, even at the end of his career, did not feel they knew him, Nixon replied, "Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know."[278]See alsoBombing of Vietnam's dikesList of Presidents of the United StatesList of Presidents of the United States, sortable by previous experienceMurray Chotiner, Nixon's campaign manager and aideNixon in China, 1987 opera byJohn AdamsNotesExplanatory notes^Black, pp.&#160;583&ndash;585.
