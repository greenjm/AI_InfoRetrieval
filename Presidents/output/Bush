ARepublican, he previously served as acongressman, an ambassador, andDirector of Central Intelligence. He is the oldest living former President and Vice President. He is also the last living former President who is a veteran ofWorld War II. Bush is often referred to as "George H. W. Bush", "Bush 41", "Bush the Elder", or "George Bush Sr." to distinguish him from his son, former PresidentGeorge W. Bush. Prior to his son's presidency, he was known simply as George Bush or President Bush.Bush was born inMilton, Massachusetts, to SenatorPrescott BushandDorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack onPearl Harborin 1941, Bush postponed college, enlisted in theU.S. Navyon his 18th birthday, and became the youngestaviatorin the U.S. Navy at the time.[1][2]He served until the end of the war, then attendedYale University. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family toWest Texasand entered theoil business, becoming a millionaire by the age of 40.He became involved in politics soon after founding his own oil company, serving as a member of theHouse of RepresentativesandDirector of Central Intelligence, among other positions. He failed to win the Republican nomination for President in1980, but was chosen by party nomineeRonald Reaganto be his running mate, and the two were elected. During his tenure, Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the "War on Drugs".In1988, Bush ran a successful campaign to succeed Reagan as President, defeatingDemocraticopponentMichael Dukakis.Foreign policydrove the Bush presidency:military operationswere conductedin Panamaandthe Persian Gulf; theBerlin Wallfell in 1989, and theSoviet Uniondissolved two years later. Domestically, Bushreneged on a 1988 campaign promiseand after a struggle with Congress, signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed. In the wake of a weak recovery from aneconomic recession, along with continuing budget deficits, he lost the1992 presidential electionto DemocratBill Clinton.Bush left office in 1993. Hispresidential librarywas dedicated in 1997, and he has been active&mdash;often alongside Bill Clinton&mdash;in various humanitarian activities. Bush's eldest son,George W. Bush, later served as the46thGovernor ofTexas(1995&ndash;2000) and as the43rdPresident of the United States (2001&ndash;2009), becoming one of only two presidents&mdash;the other beingJohn Quincy Adams&mdash;to be the son of a former president. His second son,Jeb Bush, served as the43rdGovernor of Florida (1999&ndash;2007) and is currentlyrunning for president.Contents1Early years1.1World War II1.2Marriage and college years2Business career3Political career, 1964&ndash;803.1Congressional years, 1967&ndash;713.2Ambassador to the United Nations (1971&ndash;73)3.3Chairman of the Republican National Committee (1973&ndash;74)3.4Envoy to China, 1974&ndash;753.5Director of Central Intelligence (1976&ndash;77)3.6Other positions, 1977&ndash;8041980 presidential campaign5Vice Presidency (1981&ndash;89)5.1First term, 1981&ndash;855.2Second term, 1985&ndash;895.2.11988 presidential campaign6Presidency (1989&ndash;93)6.1Domestic policy6.1.1Economy6.1.2Major initiatives6.2Points of Light6.3Daily Point of Light Award6.4Judicial appointments6.4.1Supreme Court6.4.2Other courts6.5Foreign policy6.5.1Panama6.5.2Soviet Union6.5.3Gulf War6.5.4Somali Civil War6.6NAFTA6.7Pardons6.8Honorary degrees6.9Awards and honors6.101992 presidential campaign6.11Public image7Post-presidency (1993&ndash;present)7.1Presidential library7.2Later activities8Electoral history9See also10References11Further reading12External linksEarly yearsSee also:Bush familyYoung George H. W. Bush taking his first steps at his grandfather's house inKennebunkport, Maine, c. 1925George Herbert Walker Bush was born at 173 Adams Street inMilton, Massachusetts[3]on June 12, 1924 toPrescott Sheldon BushandDorothy (Walker) Bush. The Bush family moved from Milton toGreenwich, Connecticut, shortly after his birth.Bush began his formal education at theGreenwich Country Day Schoolin Greenwich. Beginning in 1936, he attendedPhillips AcademyinAndover, Massachusetts, where he held a number of leadership positions including president of the senior class, secretary of the student council, president of the community fund-raising group, a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper, and captain of both the varsity baseball and soccer teams.[4]World War IIFollowing theattack on Pearl Harborin December 1941, Bush decided to join theUS. Navy,[1]so after graduating fromPhillips Academyin 1942, he became anaval aviatorat the age of 18.[4]After completing the 10-month course, he was commissioned as anensignin theUnited States Naval ReserveatNaval Air Station Corpus Christion June 9, 1943, just three days before his 19th birthday, which made him the youngest naval aviator to that date.[1]He was assigned to Torpedo Squadron (VT-51) as the photographic officer in September 1943.[1]The following year, his squadron was based on theUSS&#160;San Jacintoas a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname "Skin".[5]During this time, the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II: theBattle of the Philippine Sea.[1]After Bush's promotion toLieutenant (junior grade)on August 1, 1944, theSan Jacintocommenced operations against the Japanese in theBonin Islands. Bush piloted one of fourGrummanTBM Avengeraircraft from VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations onChichijima.[6]His crew for the mission, which occurred on September 2, 1944, included Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lieutenant Junior Grade William White.[1]During their attack, the Avengers encountered intenseanti-aircraftfire; Bush's aircraft was hit byflakand his engine caught on fire. Despite his plane being on fire, Bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target, scoring several damaging hits.[1]With his engine ablaze, Bush flew several miles from the island, where he and one other crew member on the TBM Avenger bailed out of the aircraft;[7]the other man'sparachutedid not open.[1]Bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft, while several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the lifeguard submarineUSS&#160;Finback.[1]For the next month he remained on theFinback, and participated in the rescue of other pilots. Several of those shot down during the attack were executed andeatenby their captors.[8]George Bush in hisTBM Avengeron the carrierUSS&#160;San Jacintoin 1944Bush subsequently returned toSan Jacintoin November 1944 and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the United States. Through 1944, he flew 58 combat missions[7]for which he received theDistinguished Flying Cross, threeAir Medals, and thePresidential Unit Citationawarded toSan Jacinto.[1]Because of his valuable combat experience, Bush was reassigned toNorfolk Navy Baseand put in a training wing for new torpedo pilots. He was later assigned as a naval aviator in a new torpedo squadron, VT-153, based atNaval Air Station Grosse Ile, Michigan. Upon the Japanese surrender in 1945, Bush was honorably discharged in September of that year.Marriage and college yearsGeorge Bush marriedBarbara Pierceon January 6, 1945, only weeks after his return from the Pacific. The couple's first residence was a small rented apartment inTrenton, Michigan, near Bush's Navy assignment atNAS Grosse Ile. Their marriage produced six children:George Walker Bush(born 1946), Pauline Robinson "Robin" Bush (1949&ndash;1953, died ofleukemia),John Ellis "Jeb" Bush(born 1953),Neil Mallon Bush(born 1955),Marvin Pierce Bush(born 1956), andDorothy Bush Koch(born 1959).[9]Bush had been accepted toYale Universityprior to his enlistment in the military, and took up the offer after his discharge and marriage.[10]While at Yale, he was enrolled in an accelerated program that allowed him to graduate in two and a half years, rather than four.[10]He was a member of theDelta Kappa Epsilonfraternity and was elected its president.[11]He also captained the Yale baseball team, and as a left-handedfirst baseman, played in the first twoCollege World Series.[10]As the team captain, Bush metBabe Ruthbefore a game during his senior year. He was also, like his father, a member of the Yale cheerleading squad.[12]Late in his junior year he was, like his fatherPrescott Bush(1917), initiated into theSkull and Bonessecret society. He graduated as a member of thePhi Beta Kappafrom Yale in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.[13]Business careerAfter graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family toWest Texas. His father's business connections proved useful as he ventured into the oil business, starting as a sales clerk withDresser Industries, a subsidiary ofBrown Brothers Harriman(where Prescott Bush had served on the board of directors for 22 years).[14]While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family:Odessa, Texas;Ventura,BakersfieldandCompton, California; andMidland, Texas.[15](According to eldest sonGeorge W. Bush, then age two, the family lived in one of the few duplexes in Odessa with an indoor bathroom, which they "shared with a couple of hookers".)[16]Bush started the Bush-Overbey Oil Development company in 1951 and in 1953 co-founded theZapata Petroleum Corporation, an oil company that drilled in thePermian Basinin Texas.[17]In 1954 he was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company, a subsidiary which specialized inoffshore drilling.In 1959, shortly after the subsidiary became independent, Bush moved the company and his family fromMidlandtoHouston.[18]He continued serving as president of the company until 1964, and later chairman until 1966, but his ambitions turned political.[14]By that time, Bush had become a millionaire.[19]Political career, 1964&ndash;80Congressional years, 1967&ndash;71Bush served as Chairman of the Republican Party forHarris County, Texas, in 1964, but wanted to be more involved in policy making, so he set his sights high: he aimed for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas.[14]After winning the Republican primary, Bush faced his opponent, incumbent DemocratRalph W. Yarborough, who attacked Bush as a right-wing extremist, and Bush lost the general election. The Republican candidate forgovernor,Jack CrichtonofDallas, aLouisiananative who often campaigned alongside Bush before the election, lost by a much wider margin to GovernorJohn B. Connally Jr.[20]It was suggested in PBS's "American Experience" episode about Bush that he and the Harris County Republicans played a role in the development of the New Republican Party of the late 20th century. First, Bush worked to absorb theJohn Birch Societymembers, who were trying to take over the Republican Party and lead it towards a moreanti-Communistdirection. Second, during and after theCivil Rights Movement, Democrats in the South who were committed tosegregationleft their party, and although the "country club Republicans" had differing ideological beliefs, they found common ground in hoping to expel the Democrats from power.[21]Bush with PresidentDwight D. EisenhowerBush was elected in 1966 to aHouse of Representatives seatfrom the 7th District of Texas, defeating with 57 percent of the ballots cast the DemocratFrank Briscoe, thedistrict attorneyof Harris County known for his law and order credentials and a cousin of later GovernorDolph Briscoe.[22][23]Bush was the first Republican to represent Houston in the U.S. House.[14]Bush's representative district includedTanglewood, the Houston neighborhood that was his residence;[24]his family had moved into Tanglewood in the 1960s.[25]His voting record in the House was generallyconservative: Bush voted for theCivil Rights Act of 1968, although it was generally unpopular in his district. He supported theNixon administration'sVietnam policies, but broke with Republicans on the issue ofbirth control, which he supported.[14]Despite being a first-term congressman, Bush was appointed to the powerfulHouse Ways and Means Committee, where he voted to abolish themilitary draft.[19]He was elected to a second term in 1968.[26]In 1970 Nixon convinced Bush to relinquish his House seat torun for the Senateagainst Ralph Yarborough, a fierce Nixon critic. In the Republican primary, Bush easily defeated conservativeRobert J. Morris, by a margin of 87.6% to 12.4%.[27]Nixon came to Texas to campaign inLongviewfor Bush and gubernatorial candidatePaul Eggers, aDallaslawyer who was a close friend of U.S. SenatorJohn G. Tower.[28]Former CongressmanLloyd Bentsen, a more moderate Democrat and native ofMissionin south Texas, defeated Yarborough in the Democratic primary.[19]Yarborough endorsed Bentsen, who defeated Bush, 53.4 to 46.6%.[29]As Bush's political career waned, he moved out of Houston and sold his first Tanglewood house, but for periods of time continued to reside in Tanglewood.[25]Ambassador to the United Nations (1971&ndash;73)Bush as ambassador to the United Nations, 1971Following his 1970 loss, Bush was well known as a prominent Republican businessman from the "Sun Belt", a group of states in the Southern part of the country.[19]Nixon noticed and appreciated the sacrifice Bush had made of his Congressional position,[14]so he appointed himAmbassador to the United Nations.[13]He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate, and served for two years, beginning in 1971.[14]Chairman of the Republican National Committee (1973&ndash;74)Amidst theWatergate scandal, Nixon asked Bush to become chairman of theRepublican National Committeein 1973.[13]Bush accepted, and held this position when the popularity of both Nixon and the Republican Party plummeted.[30]He defended Nixon steadfastly, but later as Nixon's complicity became clear, Bush focused more on defending the Republican Party, while still maintaining loyalty to Nixon. As chairman, Bush formally requested that Nixon eventually resign for the good of the Republican party.[14]Nixon did this on August 9, 1974; Bush noted in his diary that "There was an aura of sadness, like somebody died.... The [resignation] speech was vintage Nixon&mdash;a kick or two at the press&mdash;enormous strains. One couldn't help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame.... [President Gerald Ford's swearing-in offered] indeed a new spirit, a new lift."[31]Envoy to China, 1974&ndash;75Bush as United States Liaison to China, circa 1975Gerald Ford, Nixon's successor, appointed Bush to be Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China. Since the United States at the time maintained official relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and not the People's Republic of China, the Liaison Office did not have the official status of an embassy and Bush did not formally hold the position of "ambassador", though he unofficially acted as one. The 14 months that he spent in China were largely seen as beneficial forU.S.-China relations.[14]After Ford's accession to the presidency, Bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as Vice President. Ford eventually narrowed his list toNelson Rockefellerand Bush.White House Chief of StaffDonald Rumsfeldreportedly preferred Rockefeller over Bush. Rockefeller was finally named and confirmed.[32]Bush was again passed over for the vice presidency by Ford when the president chose Bush's future presidential rival, SenatorBob Dole, to replace Rockefeller on the 1976 presidential ticket.Director of Central Intelligence (1976&ndash;77)Bush, as CIA Director, listens at a meeting following the assassinations in Beirut ofFrancis E. Meloy, Jr.andRobert O. Waring, 1976.In 1976 Ford brought Bush back to Washington to becomeDirector of Central Intelligence(DCI), replacingWilliam Colby.[33]He served in this role for 357 days, from January 30, 1976, to January 20, 1977.[34]The CIA had been rocked by a series of revelations, including those based on investigations by theChurch Committeeregarding illegal and unauthorized activities by theCIA, and Bush was credited with helping to restore the agency's morale.[35]In his capacity as DCI, Bush gave national security briefings toJimmy Carterboth as a Presidential candidate and as President-elect, and discussed the possibility of remaining in that position in a Carter administration,[36]but did not do so. He was succeeded by Deputy Director of Central IntelligenceE. Henry Knoche, who served as acting Director of Central Intelligence untilStansfield Turnerwas confirmed.[37]Other positions, 1977&ndash;80After a Democratic administration took power in 1977, Bush became chairman on the Executive Committee of theFirst International Bankin Houston.[38]He later spent a year as a part-time professor of Administrative Science atRice University'sJones School of Businessbeginning in 1978, the year it opened; Bush said of his time there, "I loved my brief time in the world of academia."[39]Between 1977 and 1979, he was a director of theCouncil on Foreign Relationsforeign policy organization.[40]1980 presidential campaignSee also:United States presidential election, 1980Bush (far right) in the Nashua debate with Reagan (far left) and the moderatorBush had decided in the late 1970s that he was going to run for president in 1980; in 1979, he attended 850 political events and traveled more than 250,000 miles (400,000&#160;km) to campaign for the nation's highest office. In the contest for theRepublican Partynomination, Bush stressed his wide range of government experience, while competing against rivals SenatorHoward Bakerof Tennessee, SenatorBob Doleof Kansas, CongressmanJohn Andersonof Illinois (who would later run as an independent), CongressmanPhil Crane, also of Illinois, former GovernorJohn Connallyof Texas, and the front-runnerRonald Reagan, former actor, andGovernor of California.[32]In the primary election, Bush focused almost entirely on theIowa caucuses, while Reagan ran a more traditional campaign. Bush represented the centrist wing in the GOP, whereas Reagan represented conservatives. Bush famously labeled Reagan'ssupply side-influenced plans for massivetax cuts"voodoo economics". His strategy proved useful, to some degree, as he won in Iowa with 31.5% to Reagan's 29.4%. After the win, Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum, or "Big Mo". As a result of the loss, Reagan replaced hiscampaign manager, reorganized his staff, and concentrated on theNew Hampshire primary. The two men agreed to a debate in the state, organized by theNashua Telegraph, but paid for by the Reagan campaign. Reagan invited the other four candidates as well, but Bush refused to debate them, and eventually they left. The debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign; when the moderator, John Breen, ordered Reagan's microphone turned off, his angry response, "I am paying for this microphone," struck a chord with the public. Bush ended up losing New Hampshire's primary with 23% to Reagan's 50%. Bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well, and formally dropped out of the race in May of that year.[32]With his political future seeming dismal, Bush sold his house in Houston and bought his grandfather's estate inKennebunkport, Maine, known as "Walker's Point".[41]At theRepublican Convention, Reagan selected Bush as his Vice Presidential nominee, placing him on the winningRepublican presidential ticket of 1980.Vice Presidency (1981&ndash;89)See also:Presidency of Ronald ReaganVice Presidential portrait.First term, 1981&ndash;85As Vice President, Bush generally took on a low profile while recognizing the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way. As had become customary, he and his wife moved into the Vice President's residence atNumber One Observatory Circle, about two miles from theWhite House. After selling the house in theTanglewood, the Bushes declared a room inThe Houstonian HotelinHoustonas their official voting address.[24]The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including manystate funerals, which became a common joke for comedians. Mrs. Bush found the funerals largely beneficial, saying, "George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended, enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan." As thePresident of the Senate, Bush stayed in contact with members of Congress, and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill.[32]Bush with President Ronald ReaganOn March 30, 1981, early into the administration,Reagan was shotand seriously wounded in Washington, D.C. Bush, second in command by thepresidential line of succession, was inFort Worth, Texas, and flew back to Washington immediately. Reagan's cabinet convened in theWhite House Situation Room, where they discussed various issues, including the availability of theNuclear Football. When Bush's plane landed, his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter, as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack. Bush rejected the idea, responding, "Only the President lands on the South Lawn."[32]This made a positive impression on Reagan,[32]who recovered and returned to work within two weeks. From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in theOval Office.In December 1983 Bush flew toEl Salvadorand warned that country's military leaders to end theirdeath squadsand hold fully free elections or face the loss of U.S. aid. Bush's aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace ofÁlvaro Magańa. Bush was never told of the aides' concerns and a tense meeting was held in which some of Magańa's personnel brandished semiautomatic weapons and refused requests to take them outside.[42]Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces, onderegulationand international drug smuggling. The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules, making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise, in order to curb the size of the federal government. The drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the United States. Both were popular issues with conservatives, and Bush, largely a moderate, began courting them through his work.[32]Second term, 1985&ndash;89Reagan and Bushran for reelection in 1984. TheDemocraticopponent,Walter Mondale, made history by choosing a woman as his running mate, New York RepresentativeGeraldine Ferraro. She and Bush squared off ina single televised Vice Presidential debate.[43]Serving as a contrast to the Ivy-League educated Bush, Ferraro represented a "blue-collar" district inQueens, New York; this, coupled with her popularity among female journalists, left Bush at a disadvantage. The Reagan-Bush ticket won in a landslide against the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. Early into his second term as Vice President, Bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in 1988. By the end of 1985, a committee had been established and over two million dollars raised for Bush.[32]Bush became the first Vice President to serve asActing Presidentwhen, on July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery to removepolypsfrom hiscolon, making Bush acting president for approximately eight hours.The Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal in 1986, when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran, and had used the proceeds to fund the anticommunistContrasin Nicaragua, a direct violation of the law. When theIran-Contra Affair, as it became known, broke to the media, Bush, like Reagan, stated that he had been "out of the loop" and unaware of the diversion of funds,[44]although this was later questioned.[45]His diaries from that time stated "I'm one of the few people that know fully the details."[46]Ailes and others were concerned that Bush was seen as a "wimp", an image put to rest by his evident fury in an interview withDan Rather.[32]As Vice President, Bush officially opened the1987 Pan American GamesinIndianapolis.In 1988 the U.S. accidentally shot downIran Air Flight 655killing 290 passengers. Bush said that he would "never apologize for the United States of America. Ever. I don&rsquo;t care what the facts are."[47]1988 presidential campaignMain article:United States presidential election, 1988Vice President Bush campaigns in St. Louis, Missouri, withJohn Ashcroft, 1988In the January 26, 1987, issue ofTimemagazine, in an article entitled "Where Is the Real George Bush?" journalist Robert Ajemian reported that a friend of Bush's had urged him to spend several days atCamp Davidthinking through his plans for his prospective presidency, to which Bush is said to have responded in exasperation, "Oh, thevision thing."[48]This oft-cited quote became a shorthand for the charge that Bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner. The phrase has since become ametonymfor any politician's failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign, and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures.[49]Bush had been planning a presidential run since as early as 1985, and entered the Republican primary for President of the United States in October 1987.[32]His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U.S. SenatorBob DoleofKansas, U.S. RepresentativeJack Kempof New York, former GovernorPete DuPontofDelaware, and conservative ChristiantelevangelistPat Robertson.Though considered the early frontrunner for the nomination, Bush came in third in the Iowa caucus, behind winner Dole and runner-up Robertson.[50]Much like Reagan did in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary.[32]With Dole ahead in New Hampshire, Bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser;[51]he rebounded to win the state's primary. Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had anything to say to Bush, Dole said, in response to the ads, "yeah, stop lying about my record" in an angry tone. This is thought to have hurt Dole's campaign to Bush's benefit. Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well.[14]Once the multiple-state primaries such asSuper Tuesdaybegan, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his.[19]Leading up to the1988 Republican National Convention, there was much speculation as to Bush's choice of running mate. Bush chose little-known U.S. SenatorDan QuayleofIndiana, favored by conservatives. Despite Reagan's popularity, Bush trailed Democratic nomineeMichael Dukakis, thenGovernor of Massachusetts, in most polls.[52]Bush, occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan, delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention. Known as the "thousand points of light" speech, it described Bush's vision of America: he endorsed thePledge of Allegiance,prayer in schools,capital punishment,gun rights, andopposed abortion.[52]The speech at the convention included Bush's famous pledge: "Read my lips: no new taxes."[53]The 1988 presidential electoral votes by stateThe general election campaign between the two men has been described as one of the nastiest in modern times.[53]Bush blamed Dukakis for polluting theBoston Harboras theMassachusetts governor.[14]Bush also pointed out that Dukakis was opposed to the law that would require all students to say thePledge of Allegiance, a topic well covered in Bush's nomination acceptance speech.[52]Dukakis's unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates. ModeratorBernard Shawasked Dukakis if Dukakis would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife,Kitty, were raped and murdered.[54]Dukakis's response of no, as well as a provocative ad about convicted felonWillie Horton, contributed toward Bush's characterization of Dukakis as "soft on crime".[14]Bush defeated Dukakis and his running mate,Lloyd Bentsen, in theElectoral College, by 426 to 111 (Bentsen received one vote from afaithless elector).[53]In the nationwide popular vote, Bush took 53.4% of the ballots cast while Dukakis received 45.6%.[14]Bush became the first serving Vice President to be elected President sinceMartin Van Burenin 1836 as well as the first person to succeed someone from his own party to the Presidency via election to the office in his own right sinceHerbert Hooverin 1929.[32]Presidency (1989&ndash;93)Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquistadministering the oath of office to President Bush during Inaugural ceremonies at theUnited States Capitol, January 20, 1989.Bush wasinauguratedon January 20, 1989, succeeding Ronald Reagan. He entered office at a period of change in the world; the fall of theBerlin Walland the collapse ofSoviet Unioncame early in his presidency.[2]He ordered military operations inPanamaand thePersian Gulf, and, at one point, was recorded as having a record-high approval rating of 89%.[55]Economicrecessionand breaking his "no new taxes" pledge caused a sharp decline in his approval rating, and Bush lost the1992 election.[2]In his Inaugural Address, Bush said:I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. Thetotalitarianera is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree. A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on.

At $220&#160;billion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times its size since 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade theDemocratic controlled Congressto act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cutgovernment spending, and Democrats convinced that the only way would be toraise taxes, Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.[19]In the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised "no new taxes" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500&#160;billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharpdecrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.[19]Near the end of the101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in thecapital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.[14]Bush's approval ratings (red) compared to his disapproval ratings (blue) for his four-year presidency.Coming at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.[19]As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.[14]The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.By his second year in office, Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, theCensus Bureaureported that 14.2% of all Americanslived in poverty.[14]At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.[19]Major initiativesSee also:Environmental policy of the United States § The George H. W. Bush Administration (1988&ndash;1992)During a speech to commemorate the 20th anniversary of theApollo 11moon landing, Bush announced a vision to completeSpace StationFreedom, resume exploration of theMoonand begin exploration ofMars.[57]Although a space station was eventually constructed&ndash;work on theInternational Space Stationbegan in 1998&ndash;other work has been confounded by NASA budgetary issues. In 1998, Bush received theRotary National Award for Space Achievement's National Space Trophyfor his pioneering leadership of the U.S. space program.Bush signed a number of major laws in his presidency, including theAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990; this was one of the most pro-civil rightsbills in decades. He is also the only President to successfully veto a civil rights act, having vetoed the job-discrimination protectionCivil Rights Act of 1990.[58]Bush feared racial quotas would be imposed, but later approved watered-downCivil Rights Act of 1991.[59]He worked to increase federal spending for education, childcare, and advanced technology research. He also signed theRadiation Exposure Compensation Actwhich provides monetary compensation of people who were contracted cancer and a number of other specified diseases disease as a direct result of their exposure to atmosphericnuclear testingundertaken by the United States during theCold War, or their exposure to high levels ofradonwhile doinguranium mining. In dealing with the environment, Bush reauthorized theClean Air Act, requiring cleaner burning fuels. He quarreled with Congress over an eventually signed bill to aid police in capturing criminals, and signed into law a measure to improve the nation's highway system.[19]Bush signed theImmigration Act of 1990,[60]which led to a 40 percent increase in legalimmigration to the United States.[61]Bush became a life member of theNational Rifle Associationearly in 1988 and had campaigned as a "pro-gun" candidate with the NRA's endorsement.[62]In March 1989, he placed a temporary ban on the import of certain semiautomatic rifles.[63]This action cost him endorsement from the NRA in 1992. Bush publicly resigned his life membership in the organization after receiving a form letter from NRA depicting agents of theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearmsas "jack-booted thugs." He called the NRA letter a "vicious slander on good people."[64]Points of LightMain article:Points of LightPresident Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. He often used the "thousand points of light" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems. In his 1989 inaugural address, President Bush said, "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good."[65]Four years later in his report to the nation on The Points of Light Movement, President Bush said, "Points of Light are the soul of America. They are ordinary people who reach beyond themselves to touch the lives of those in need, bringing hope and opportunity, care and friendship. By giving so generously of themselves, these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what all of us are called to become."[65]In 1990 the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit ofvolunteerism.[66]In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with theHands On Networkwith the goal of strengthening volunteerism, streamlining costs and services and deepening impact.[67]Points of Light, the organization created through this merger, has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world. In 2012, Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth $635 million.[68]On October 16, 2009, PresidentBarack Obamaheld a Presidential Forum on Service hosted by former President George H. W. Bush and Points of Light at theGeorge Bush Presidential LibraryCenter on the campus ofTexas A&amp;M University. The event celebrated the contributions of more than 4,500 Daily Point of Light award winners and honored President Bush's legacy of service and civic engagement.[69]In 2011 Points of Light paid tribute to President George H. W. Bush and volunteer service at Washington, D.C.'sKennedy Center. President Bush was joined by PresidentsJimmy Carter,Bill Clinton, andGeorge W. Bushto highlight the role volunteer service plays in people's lives.[70]Daily Point of Light AwardPresident Bush created the Daily Point of Light Award in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems. The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations, both to honor them for their tremendous work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts. By the end of his administration, President Bush had recognized 1,020 Daily Points of Light representing all 50 states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for thehomeless.[65]The Daily Point of Light continues to be awarded by Points of Light and President Bush continues to sign all of the awards.[71]On July 15, 2013, PresidentBarack Obamawelcomed President Bush to the White House to celebrate the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award.[72]They bestowed the award on Floyd Hammer and Kathy Hamilton ofUnion, Iowa, for their work founding Outreach, a nonprofit that delivers free meals to hungry children in 15 countries.[73]Judicial appointmentsSupreme CourtMain article:George H. W. Bush Supreme Court candidatesBush appointed the following Justices to theSupreme Court of the United States:David Souter&ndash; 1990Clarence Thomas&ndash; 1991Other courtsMain article:George H. W. Bush judicial appointmentsIn addition to his twoSupreme Courtappointments, Bush appointed 42 judges to theUnited States Courts of Appeals, and 148 judges to theUnited States district courts. Among these appointments wasVaughn R. Walker, who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge.[74]Bush also experienced a number ofjudicial appointment controversies, as 11 nominees for 10federal appellate judgeshipswere not processed by theDemocrat-controlledSenate Judiciary Committee.[75]Foreign policyBush speaks on the telephone regarding Operation Just Cause with GeneralBrent Scowcroftand Chief of StaffJohn H. Sununu, 1989PanamaMain article:United States invasion of PanamaIn the 1980s, Panamanian leaderManuel Noriega, a once U.S.-supportive leader who was later accused of spying forFidel Castroand using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States, was one of the most recognizable names in America and was constantly in the press. The struggle to remove him from power began in the Reagan administration, when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56&#160;million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well.[76]Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.[77]In May 1989, Panama held democratic elections, in whichGuillermo Endarawas elected president; the results were then annulled by Noriega's government. In response, Bush sent 2,000 more troops to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in Panamanian territory (in violation of prior treaties). Bush then removed an embassy andambassadorfrom the country, and dispatched additional troops to Panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion.[76]Noriega suppressed an Octobermilitary coupattempt and massive protests in Panama against him, but after a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered 24,000 troops into the country with an objective of removing Noriega from power;[78]"Operation Just Cause" was a large-scale American military operation, and the first in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War.[77]The mission was controversial, but American forces achieved control of the country and Endara assumed the Presidency.[79]Noriega surrendered to the United States and was convicted and imprisoned onracketeeringand drug trafficking charges in April 1992.[80]President Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush visited Panama in June 1992, to give support to the first post-invasion Panamanian government.Soviet UnionSee also:Dissolution of the Soviet Union,New world order (politics),A World TransformedandHistory of the United States (1988&ndash;present) § The end of the Cold WarBush andMikhail Gorbachevin Helsinki summit in 1990In 1989, just after thefall of the Berlin Wall, Bush met withSoviet General SecretaryMikhail Gorbachevina conferenceon the Mediterranean island ofMalta. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found theMalta Summitto be a step in the right direction; GeneralBrent Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be "premature" due to concerns where, according toCondoleezza Rice, "expectations [would be] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [the U.S.] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." But European leaders, includingFrançois MitterrandandMargaret Thatcher, encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev,[81]something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989.[82]Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation.... This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period."[83]The meeting was received as a very important step to the end of the Cold War.[84]Another summit was held in July 1991, where theStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I)was signed by Bush and Gorbachev in Moscow. The treaty took nine years in the making and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of theIntermediate Ranged Nuclear Forces Treatyby Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987. The contentions in START would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the USSR by about 35% over seven years, and the Soviet Union's land-basedintercontinental ballistic missileswould be cut by 50%. Bush described START as "a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust".[85]After thedissolution of the USSRin 1991, President Bush and Gorbachev declared a U.S.-Russian strategic partnership, marking the end of theCold War.Gulf WarMain article:Gulf WarPresident Bush visited American troops in Saudi Arabia onThanksgiving Day, 1990On August 2, 1990, Iraq, led bySaddam Hussein, invaded its oil-rich neighbor to the south,Kuwait; Bush condemned the invasion[86]and began rallying opposition to Iraq in the US and among European, Asian, and Middle Eastern allies.[19]Secretary of DefenseRichard Bruce "Dick" Cheneytraveled to Saudi Arabia to meet withKing Fahd; Fahd requested US military aid in the matter, fearing a possible invasion of his country as well.[86]The request was met initially withAir Forcefighter jets. Iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal that would allow the country to take control of half of Kuwait. Bush rejected this proposal and insisted on a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces.[19]The planning of a ground operation by US-led coalition forces began forming in September 1990, headed by GeneralNorman Schwarzkopf.[86]Bush spoke before a joint session of theU.S. Congressregarding the authorization of air and land attacks, laying out four immediate objectives: "Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately, and without condition. Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. And American citizens abroad must be protected." He then outlined a fifth, long-term objective: "Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective &ndash; a new world order &ndash; can emerge: a new era &ndash; freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.... A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak."[87]With theUnited Nations Security Councilopposed to Iraq's violence, Congress authorized theuse of Military force[86]with a set goal of returning control of Kuwait to the Kuwaiti government, and protecting America's interests abroad.[19]Early on the morning of January 17, 1991, allied forces launched the first attack, which included more than 4,000 bombing runs by coalition aircraft. This pace would continue for the next four weeks, until a ground invasion was launched on February 24, 1991. Allied forces penetrated Iraqi lines and pushed towardKuwait Citywhile on the west side of the country, forces were intercepting the retreating Iraqi army. Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours. Critics labeled this decision premature, as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape; Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U.S. casualties. Opponents further charged that Bush should have continued the attack, pushing Hussein's army back to Baghdad, then removing him from power.[19]Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have "incurred incalculable human and political costs.... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq."[88]Bush's approval ratings skyrocketed after the successful offensive.[19]Additionally, President Bush and Secretary of State Baker felt the coalition victory had increased U.S. prestige abroad and believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the coalition victory to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process. The administration immediately returned to Arab-Israeli peacemaking following the end of the Gulf War; this resulted in theMadrid Conference, later in 1991.[89]Somali Civil WarMain article:Somali Civil WarFaced with a humanitarian disaster inSomalia, exacerbated by a complete breakdown in civil order, the United Nations had created theUNOSOM Imission in April 1992 to aid the situation through humanitarian efforts, though the mission failed.[90]The Bush administration proposed American aid to the region by assisting in creating a secure environment for humanitarian efforts and UN Resolution 794 was unanimously adopted by theSecurity Councilon December 3, 1992.[91]Alame duckpresident, Bush launchedOperation Restore Hopethe following day under which the United States would assume command in accordance with Resolution 794.[92]Fighting would escalate and continue into the Clinton administration.[93]NAFTAMain article:North American Free Trade AgreementFrom left to right: (standing) PresidentCarlos Salinas, President Bush, Prime MinisterBrian Mulroney; (seated)Jaime Serra Puche,Carla Hills, andMichael Wilsonat the NAFTA Initialing Ceremony, October 1992Bush's administration, along with theProgressive ConservativeCanadian Prime MinisterBrian Mulroney, spearheaded the negotiations of theNorth American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA), which would eliminate the majority oftariffson products traded among the United States, Canada, and Mexico, to encourage trade amongst the countries. The treaty also restricts patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and outlines the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries.[94]The agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA resulted in a loss of American jobs.[19]NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change.[95]While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots&mdash;with the addition of two side agreements&mdash;to achieve its passage in 1993.[96]The treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further. The American economy has grown 54% since the adoption of NAFTA in 1993, with 25&#160;million new jobs created; this was seen by some as evidence of NAFTA being beneficial to the United States.[97]With talk in early 2008 regarding a possible American withdrawal from the treaty,Carlos M. Gutierrez, currentUnited States Secretary of Commerce, writes, "Quitting NAFTA would send economic shock waves throughout the world, and the damage would start here at home."[97]But John J. Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, wrote inThe Boston Globethat "theU.S. trade deficitwith Canada and Mexico ballooned to 12 times its pre-NAFTA size, reaching $111&#160;billion in 2004."[98]On January 8, 1992,Bush fainted after vomiting at a banquethosted by the thenPrime Minister of Japan,Kiichi Miyazawa. Bush was suffering fromgastroenteritis.PardonsMain article:List of people pardoned by George H. W. BushAs other presidents have done, Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office. On December 24, 1992, he granted executive clemency to six former government employees implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal of the late 1980s, most prominently former Secretary of DefenseCaspar Weinberger.[99]Bush described Weinberger, who was scheduled to stand trial on January 5, 1993, for criminal charges related to Iran-Contra, as a "true American patriot".[99]In addition to Weinberger, Bush pardoned Duane R. Clarridge, Clair E. George,Robert C. McFarlane,Elliott Abrams, and Alan G. Fiers Jr., all of whom had been indicted and/or convicted of criminal charges by anIndependent Counselheaded by Lawrence Walsh.[100]Honorary degreesTexas A&amp;M University[101]Sacred Heart University[102]Dartmouth College, awarded aDoctor of Laws[103]Harvard Universityawarded aDoctor of Lawsdegree on May 29, 2014.[104][105]This list isincomplete; you can help byexpanding it.Awards and honorsIn 1990Timemagazine named him theMan of the Year. In 1991 the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Bush its Lone Sailor award for his naval service and his subsequent government service. In 1993, he was made an HonoraryKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bathby Queen Elizabeth II.[106]1992 presidential campaignMain article:United States presidential election, 1992Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, reelection initially looked likely. As a result, many leading Democrats declined to seek their party's presidential nomination. But an economic recession, and doubts of whether Bush ended the Gulf War properly, reduced his popularity.Conservative political columnistPat Buchananchallenged Bush for the Republican nomination, and shocked political pundits by finishing second, with 37% of the vote, in the New Hampshire primary. Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues, in an attempt to undermine Buchanan's base.[19]Once he had secured the nomination, Bush faced his challenger, Democrat andGovernor of ArkansasWilliam Jefferson "Bill" Clinton. Clinton attacked Bush as not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being "out of touch" with the common man, a notion reinforced by reporterAndrew Rosenthal's false report that Bush was "astonished" to see a demonstration of a supermarketscanner.[107]The 1992 presidential electoral votes by stateIn early 1992, the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaireH. Ross Perotlaunched a third party bid, claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient. His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties' perceived fiscal irresponsibility.[108]Perot later bowed out of the race for a short time, then reentered.[109]Clinton had originally been in the lead, until Perot reentered, tightening the race significantly.[110]Nearing election day, polls suggested that the race was a dead-heat,[14]but Clinton pulled out on top, defeating Bush in a 43% to 38% popular vote margin. Perot won 19% of the popular vote, one of the highest totals for a third party candidate in U.S. history, drawing equally from both major candidates, according to exit polls.[19][111]Bush received 168 electoral votes to Clinton's 370.[112]Several factors were key in Bush's defeat. The ailing economy which arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush's loss, as 7 in 10 voters said on election day that the economy was either "not so good" or "poor".[113][114]On the eve of the 1992 election against these factors, Bush's approval rating stood at just 37%[115]after suffering low ratings throughout the year.[116]Conservative Republicans point to Bush's 1990 agreement to raise taxes in contradiction of his famous "Read my lips: no new taxes" pledge. In doing so, Bush alienated many members of his conservative base, losing their support for his re-election. According to one survey, of the voters who cited Bush's broken "No New Taxes" pledge as "very important", two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.[117]Bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit, which has largely been attributed to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s. The tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval ratings to the extent that it prevented it from reaching 89% during theGulf War, four months after the tax vote.[118]By February 1991 his approval rating rose to its highest level&mdash;89%.[119]Public imageBush is visitingNAS JRB, New Orleans personnel before receiving briefs on the status ofJoint Task Force Katrinarelief efforts, October 2005George Bush was widely seen as a "pragmatic caretaker" president who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts.[120][121][122]Indeed, Bush'ssound bitewhere he refers to the issue of overarching purpose as "the vision thing" has become ametonymapplied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties.[123][124][125][126][127][128]"He does not say why he wants to be there", wrote columnist George Will, "so the public does not know why it should care if he gets his way".[129]HisIvy Leagueand prep school education led to warnings by advisors that his image was too "preppy" in 1980, which resulted in deliberate efforts in his 1988 campaign to shed the image, including meeting voters at factories and shopping malls, abandoning set speeches.[129]His ability to gain broad international support for theGulf Warand the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph,[130]rousing bipartisan approval,[131]though his decision to withdraw without removingSaddam Husseinleft mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy.[132]ANew York Timesarticle mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarketbarcode reader; the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was "out of touch". Amid theearly 1990s recession, his image shifted from "conquering hero" to "politician befuddled by economic matters".[107]Although Bush became the first elected Republican president since Hoover in1932to lose a reelection bid (facing a 34% approval rating leading up to the 1992 election), the mood did not last. Despite his defeat, Bush climbed back from election day approval levels to leave office in 1993 with a 56% job approval rating.[133]By December 2008, 60% of Americans gave Bush's presidency a positive rating.[134]Post-presidency (1993&ndash;present)Upon leaving office, Bush retired with his wife, Barbara, and temporarily moved into a friend's house near theTanglewoodcommunity of Houston as they prepared to build a permanent retirement house nearby.[135]Ultimately they built their retirement house in the community ofWest Oaks, near Tanglewood.[25]They had a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building onMemorial Drive.[136]Mimi Swartz ofNational Geographicwrote that "The Bushes are too studiously sedate to live inRiver Oaks".[137]They spend the summer atWalker's PointinKennebunkport, Maine. On January 10, 1999, the Bushes became the longest-married Presidential couple in history, outlastingJohnandAbigail Adams, who were married for 54 years and 3 days. At 70 years as of January 2015,[138]they still hold the record, by a year and a half, overJimmyandRosalynn Carter. Bush holds his own fishing tournament inIslamorada, an island in theFlorida Keys.[citation needed]In 1993, Bush was awarded an honoraryknighthood(GCB) byQueen Elizabeth II. He was the third American president to receive the honor, the others being Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.[106]In 1993, Bush visited Kuwait to commemorate the coalition's victory over Iraq in the Gulf War, where he was targeted in an assassination plot. Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 people allegedly involved in using a car bomb to kill Bush. Through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bomb's circuitry and wiring, the FBI established that the plot had been directed by theIraqi Intelligence Service. A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants. Two months later, in retaliation, Clinton ordered thefiringof 23cruise missilesat Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters inBaghdad. The day before the strike, U.S. Ambassador to the UNMadeleine Albrightwent before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot. After the missiles were fired, Vice PresidentAl Goresaid the attack "was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot" to assassinate Bush "was hatched and implemented".[139]From 1993 to 1999 he served as the chairman to the board of trustees forEisenhower Fellowships, and from 2007 to 2009 was chairman of theNational Constitution Center.In 1997, the same year as the opening of his Presidential Library, the Houston international airport was renamedGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport.President Bush is Honorary Chairman ofPoints of Light, an international nonprofit dedicated to engaging more people and resources in solving serious social problems through voluntary service.[140]His eldest son,George W. Bush, was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States on January 20, 2001, and re-elected in 2004. Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as "George Bush" or "President Bush", but following his son's election the need to distinguish between them has maderetronymicforms such as "George H. W. Bush" and "George Bush senior"&mdash;and colloquialisms such as "Bush 41" and "Bush the Elder" much more common.Presidential libraryMain article:George Bush Presidential LibraryThe George Bush Presidential Library is thepresidential librarynamed for Bush. This tenth presidential library was built between 1995 and 1997 and contains the presidential and vice-presidential papers of Bush and the vice-presidential papers ofDan Quayle.[141]It was dedicated on November 6, 1997, and opened to the public shortly thereafter; the architectural firm ofHellmuth, Obata and Kassabaumdesigned the complex.The George Bush Presidential Library and Museum is located on a 90-acre (360,000&#160;m2) site on the west campus ofTexas A&amp;M UniversityinCollege Station, Texas, on a plaza adjoining the Presidential Conference Center and the Texas A&amp;M Academic Center. The Library operates underNARA's administration and thePresidential Libraries Act of 1955's provisions.TheGeorge Bush School of Government and Public Serviceis a graduatepublic policy schoolat Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas. The graduate school is part of the presidential library complex, and offers four programs: two master's degree programs (Public Service AdministrationandInternational Affairs) and two certificate programs (Advanced International AffairsandHomeland Security). The master's program in International Affairs (MPIA) program offers concentration on eitherNational SecurityAffairs or International Economics andDevelopment.Later activitiesBush continues to make many public appearances.

McClure, chief executive of the Bush library foundation, organized a three-day gathering in College Park, TX, to mark the 25th anniversary of the Bush administration. Also in early 2014, theJohn F.

Fifty thousand dollars of the prize was directed by Bush to theBush schoolatTexas A&amp;Mand $25,000 will fund an animation about theSiege of Yorktownfor Mt.

He made the parachute jump from a helicopter near his home at 11:15&#160;a.m. in Kennebunkport, Maine. The jump marked the eighth time the former president had skydived, including jumps on his 80th and 85th birthday as well.[159]He hadtweetedabout the incident prior to the jump, saying "It's a wonderful day in Maine &mdash; in fact, nice enough for a parachute jump.".[160][161]Bush delivers a eulogy to Ronald Reagan, June 11, 2004 in theWashington National CathedralBush, along withGeorge W.
